\section{Abstract}\label{abstract}}

Every year thousands of scientific articles are published concerning the
chronic neurodegenerative disorder and leading cause of dementia,
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently there are no treatments that cure
AD, however the second anti-amyloid disease-modifying immunotherapy,
lecanemab, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on 06-01-2023.
LDA topic modelling has previously been used to describe the AD research
landscape, however the effect of novel treatments has not been explored.
Using text mining and topic modelling, full abstract text between
01-01-2022 and 30-12-2023, and containing the MeSH term ``Alzheimer's
Disease'' from PubMed and preprint databases, were allocated to two
corpuses determined by the accelerated approval date for lecanemab.
Despite the frequency of literature increasing concerning terms relating
to lecanumab, topics mentioning neurodegeneration, study terminology,
and cellular and molecular pathologies have remained consistent
surrounding its approval. Increasing per-topic-per-word probabilities
for `tau' and `placebo' may suggest the research is shifting towards new
therapeutic targets and advances in later phase clinical trials, however
a longer follow up period will be necessary to validate these findings.

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\hypertarget{alzheimers-disease}{%
\subsection{Alzheimer's Disease}\label{alzheimers-disease}}

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease
affecting over 55 million people worldwide, and is the most common cause
of dementia (1). The predominant symptoms of AD usually manifest after
the age of 65 and include cognitive impairment, physical and emotional
difficulties (2). The mechanisms determining the progression of AD are
not fully understood, but many agree on the amyloid or tau hypotheses,
originating from the presence of amyloid-beta (AÎ²) plaques and
neurofibrillary tau tangles frequently found in the brains of patients
with AD (3,4). These abnormal proteins lead to disruptions in neuronal
signalling pathways and mediate cell death (5,6). Degeneration of the
hippocampus, which is a region vital for memory, and cortical atrophy
can leads to cognitive decline seen in AD (7,8).

AD diagnosis requires the presence of both amyloid and tau pathologies,
and signs of neuroinflammation, neuronal death and brain atrophy (9).
Biomarkers of neuroinflammation can be found in cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) and blood plasma (10) or using brain imaging such as positron
emission tomography (PET) (11). Brain atrophy can be measured with
techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (12). Abnormal
protein deposits manifest in the brain before the onset of symptoms,
therefore early detection is required to prevent the spread of AD
pathologies and identify the right stage to administer treatments.

AD also has multiple risk factors suggesting age, epigenetic modifiers,
infectious agents, and diet all contribute to the development of AD
(13,14). An epidemiological comparison of people aged 65 years and older
from two different decades, suggested that the prevalence of AD is
decreasing due to an improvement in other lifestyle factors (15).
Observational studies are useful to identify other factors that are
important in the search to find treatments to target the key AD
pathologies.

\hypertarget{treatments-for-ad}{%
\subsection{Treatments for AD}\label{treatments-for-ad}}

There are currently no therapies or interventions that can cure AD, but
several approved treatments exist to manage cognitive impairment, to
alleviate symptoms, and enhance the overall quality of life for
patients. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchE) aim to increase the
levels of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine which are attenuated during
the pathologies of AD and associated with the loss of cholinergic
neurons (16). Whilst AchEs provide many benefits to treat the symptoms
of AD, they do not delay or stop the progression of the disease and the
effects may only last for 12-24 months (17). Mementine is a NMDA
receptor antagonist which inhibits glutamate mediated neurotoxicity
caused by neuronal cell death during AD progression (18). Memantine has
been approved for moderate severe to severe AD, however the drug has not
been shown to slow the progression of the disease or prove effective in
mild-to-moderate stages of the disease (19,20).

Two anti-amyloid human monoclonal immunotherapies, aducanumab and
lecanemab, have recently been granted approval by the United States Food
and Drug Administration (US FDA) which aim to reduce the AÎ² plaques in
the AD brain (21,22). Aducanumab approval was rejected by the European
Medicines Agency (EMA) due to the conflicting phase III clinical trial
evidence and concerns over patient safety (23,24), whereas lecanumab is
currently under review by the EMA for approval (25). Aducanemab targets
the soluble AÎ² oligomers and insoluble fibrils whereas lecanumab targets
the soluble AÎ² protofibrils, but both led to the development of severe
adverse events including amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA)
(26,27). These results suggest further research is needed to understand
the full molecular causes of AD to help find safe yet effective
treatments.

Recent comprehensive reviews have identified a shift in research with
more Phase I studies being conducted and four more anti-amyloid
monoclonal antibody treatments having completing or currently undergoing
Phase III clinical trials (28,29). These trials are involving more
patients with early onset AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to help
develop preventative therapies. Global estimates for people living with
preclinical AD or positive for AD pathology biomarkers were 69 and 315
million, respectively (30), therefore increasing research focus on these
patient populations is imperative to slow the progression of the
disease. These reviews have not been updated since the accelerated
approval of lecanemab, therefore we aim to identify whether there is a
transition in research topics with the emergence of these novel
disease-modifying treatments to target the underlying pathologies of AD
rather than treating the symptoms.

\hypertarget{text-mining-and-topic-modelling-in-ad-research}{%
\subsection{Text Mining and Topic Modelling in AD
Research}\label{text-mining-and-topic-modelling-in-ad-research}}

Thousands of articles are released every year concerning AD and the
Alzheimer's Association publishes an annual report to describe the
public health impact of AD for caregivers and society (2). Systematic
reviews and meta-analyses, however, are time consuming and labour
intensive, and pose a significant challenge to updating the current
understandings in the research literature (31). Topic modelling, an
unsupervised machine learning technique, can find patterns and
relationships within natural language data, and could provide an
automated and unbiased overview of research text. The most common topic
modelling method is Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) which assumes, for
unstructured text data like research publication, that each document is
made up of a number of topics and that each topic is made up of a
collection of words (32). Each LDA topic is represented as a probability
of words within a topic and a probability of topics within each
document, which each follow a Dirichlet distribution.

\emph{In silico} topic modelling has been used for various applications
relating to AD, including identifying novel biomarkers (33), and drug
repurposing (34). LDA has also been used to describe trends in the
research landscape, however this has only been achieved until 01-01-2022
(35,36). Guan \emph{et al} (36) identified fourteen clusters from
abstract text from 95,876 papers published between 2007 and 2016 with
the entry term `Alzheimer's Disease'. Topics included the burden of AD
such as `cost' and `health' as well as protein terminology such as `APP'
which related to the amyloid-precursor protein which is cleaved into
amyloid-beta via the amyloidogenic pathway (37). Martinelli (35)
performed a nine-topic LDA model and identified five mechanistic themes,
one topic relating to AD diagnosis and three concerning treatments.
Whilst both descriptive analyses using LDA topic modelling have
identified key topics in AD research, further research was suggested to
validate their findings.

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have described the AD research
landscape since this period and explored whether the emergence of newly
approved immunotherapy treatments have affected research themes. We
therefore aimed to comprehensively characterise AD research through the
period that the AD drug, lecanemab, underwent accelerated approval for
early AD on 06-01-2023 . We hypothesised that new treatments targeting
the pathophysiological changes in patients with AD represent a major
paradigm shift in AD research. We proposed that LDA topic models could
summarise the latest research and help identify distinct thematic
changes in the literature. Furthermore, this method could help
understand the complexities of AD and be translated to other
neurodegenerative diseases to study the impact of emerging novel
treatments.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

A full summary of the methodology is provided in
Figure~\ref{fig-full-summary}. All data analysis and visualisations were
done in R version 4.3.2 using \emph{tidyverse} packages (38) unless
otherwise stated.

\hypertarget{data-acquisition}{%
\subsection{Data Acquisition}\label{data-acquisition}}

Due to accessing constraints, abstracts represent the only document
content for this study. Titles, full abstract text, and publication date
were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) datasbase, PubMed, using the inclusion criteria described in
Table~\ref{tbl-inclusion-criteria}, and accessed through \emph{Rismed}
(39) on 18-02-2024. Results from PubMed were combined with publications
from the preprint data sources, bioRxiv and medXriv, using
\emph{medrxiv} (40). Entries were assigned Medical Subject Headings
(MeSH) which identified health-related terms within each document,
therefore classifying articles according to their subject nature. An
additional dataset was generated for abstracts containing the associated
terminology for the AD drug lecanemab: `\emph{lecanemab}',
`\emph{leqembi}' `\emph{BAN2401}', and `\emph{mAb158}'.

\hypertarget{litsearchr}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emph{litsearchR}}{litsearchR}}\label{litsearchr}}

To reassure us that the PubMed search query encapsulated all literature,
we used \emph{litsearchr} to automate identifying search terms and
reduce bias in the initial keyword selection by using co-occurrence
networks (41). Citations from the PubMed results, using the previous
search criteria in Table~\ref{tbl-inclusion-criteria}, were read into R.
The combined unique keyword and titles, as not all articles have
keywords, for each result were collected. To ensure only the most
relevant terms were searched, stop words were removed as these contained
very frequent terms that provided no significant information, such as
`the', `and' or `a'. The minimum frequency of words for keywords and
title was then set to n = 50 and n = 75, respectively. A
document-frequency matrix of each search term in each article was
created and computed into a co-occurrence network using
\emph{create\_network} (42). The potential search terms were ranked
using \emph{strength} (43) and the change point method calculated the
optimal cutoff positions where the strength of the next strongest term
was greater than the previous one.

\hypertarget{data-preprocessing}{%
\subsection{Data Preprocessing}\label{data-preprocessing}}

Abstracts and their metadata were categorised into two corpuses:
`Pre-Lecanemab Accelerated Approval' and `Post-Lecanemab Accelerated
Approval', based on their publication date relative to the date of
lecanemab's accelerated early approval, 06-01-2023 (22). Full abstract
text was tokenised into one-, two- and three-word tokens using
\emph{tidytext} (44) (Figure~\ref{fig-preprocess-1}). Stop words,
combined with the words frequent to the unigram analysis,
``\emph{alzheimer's}'' and ``\emph{ad}'', were then removed
(Figure~\ref{fig-preprocess-2}). To prevent the different spellings of
the same phrase from being counted multiple times, similar bigrams and
trigrams were mapped to the same variable. For example, `\emph{amyloid
Î²}, `\emph{beta amyloid}', and `\emph{amyloid aÎ²}' were all mapped to
`\emph{amyloid beta}', and `\emph{mild cognitive impairments}' and
`\emph{cognitive impairment mci}' were mapped to `\emph{mild cognitive
impairment}'. Additionally, for bigrams originating from trigrams,
mapping to the first two terms was used or mapping to an acronym, for
example `\emph{central nervous}' and `\emph{system cns'} were mapped
to'\emph{cns}'.

\hypertarget{data-analysis}{%
\subsection{Data Analysis}\label{data-analysis}}

\hypertarget{frequency-analysis}{%
\subsubsection{Frequency Analysis}\label{frequency-analysis}}

The frequency of all eligible abstracts published per month as well as
the frequency of publications containing the associated terminology for
the AD drug lecanemab were visualised.

After tokenisation, the top 15 most frequent unigrams were determined
for each dataset. The top 15 most frequent bigrams and trigrams were
also determined due to many unigrams being associated with pairs or
triplets of words. For example, ``\emph{mild cognitive impairment}''
relates to a neurological condition, whereas the words ``\emph{mild}'',
``\emph{cognitive}'' and ``\emph{impairment}'' have ambiguous
connotations individually. A generalised linear model (GLM) was used to
determine whether there was a significant change in word usage per
months for the most frequent unigrams shared by both corpuses.

\hypertarget{topic-modelling}{%
\subsubsection{Topic Modelling}\label{topic-modelling}}

A document term matrix (dtm) was constructed for each dataset,
indicating each word's term frequency (tf), which is a measure of how
often a word appears in each abstract. To determine if a statistical
model could distinguish between the text corpuses surrounding the
accelerated approval date of lecanemab, a two-topic Latent Dirich
Allocation (LDA) model (32) was applied to the dtm using
\emph{topicmodels} (45). The per-document-per-topic probabilities (Î³)
was extracted to show the proportion of words generated in each topic
and how often these words appear in either corpuses.

Two ten-topic LDA models were also created, one for each text corpuses,
to determine the most frequent topics. In each model the abstracts were
considered mixtures of topics and each topic was considered a mixture of
words. The per-topic-per-word probabilities (Î²) were extracted and the
top 10 terms most common words found in each topic were visualised.
Topic titles were manually created and validated by a neuroscience
expert.

\hypertarget{results-and-discussion}{%
\section{Results and Discussion}\label{results-and-discussion}}

The final dataset contained 6744 abstracts that were published between
01-01-2022 and 30-12-2023 (Figure~\ref{fig-results-summary}).

stop-word removal were calculated.}

\hypertarget{search-query-refinement-identified-the-term-alzheimer}{%
\subsection{Search Query Refinement Identified the Term
`alzheimer'}\label{search-query-refinement-identified-the-term-alzheimer}}

Our initial search query was refined using \emph{litsearchr} (41) to
determine the most important terms to the articles ranked by their
strength (Figure~\ref{fig-ad-search-terms}). We disregarded
`\emph{alzheimer's disease}' as this MeSH term was included in the
original search query, but we updated the PubMed search query with
`\emph{alzheimer}' (Table~\ref{tbl-inclusion-criteria}). We omitted the
unigram `\emph{disease}' as this term was too broad and may have
encapsulated articles concerning other irrelevant neurodegenerative
diseases into our query. We inclued English articles only, which are
estimated to be about 75\% of the scientific literature (46).

Due to our search strategy, a lot of papers containing the MeSH term
`Alzheimer's disease' may have been mentioned as a collective with other
neurodegenerative diseases. MeSH terms are added manually to articles in
PubMed, therefore there could be an interpretive bias when authors add
these to their publications. We tried to avoid this by filtering the
titles and abstracts of PubMed articles to also contain the term
`\emph{alzheimer's disease}', `\emph{ad}' or `\emph{alzheimer}'.
Similarly when MeSH terms were not available for the bioRxiv and medRxv
databases, we used a similar search strategy to filter titles and
abstract text to contain the term `\emph{alzheimer's disease}' or
`\emph{alzheimer}', or `\emph{ad}' and `\emph{alzheimer's disease}'.
This filtering may have biased our dataset as abstracts not containing
these search terms were omitted despite the full article text
potentially concerning AD, however abstract text has previously been
used to identify themese in AD literature (36). We would, however,
suggest that further studies use full article text to help validate our
findings.

\subsection{Increased lecanemab publication frequency did not impact AD
research
topics}\label{increased-lecanemab-publication-frequency-did-not-impact-ad-research-topics}}

Lecanemab received accelerated and traditional approval in 2023 (22,47),
however we did not find any variability in the overall frequency of
literature published containing the MeSH term `\emph{Alzheimer's
Disease}', with 3,468 abstracts published before and 3,276 abstracts
published after the accelerated approval of lecanemab
(Figure~\ref{fig-results-summary}, Figure~\ref{fig-publication-date-1}).
Despite the frequency of publications containing the terms associated
with the AD drug lecanemab exponentially increasing in 2023
(Figure~\ref{fig-publication-date-2}), there was no significant
difference between the per-document-per-topic probabilities (Î³) for the
two-topic LDA models (Figure~\ref{fig-gamma-lda}). This suggests that
the increase in abstracts concerning lecanemab did not separate the
literature into two distinct topics based on differing themes.

\newpage{}

One reason for there not being any statistical significance between the
per-document-per-topic probabilities could be due to the two-year time
period being too short to account for a change in the research
landscape, as previous studies have used a five-year or ten-year time
period to characterise topics in AD literature (36). Whilst no studies
have compared LDA topics in two time periods, changes in AD research may
take multiple years to manifest. Further research should explore a
larger time period after the accelerated approval of lecanemab to
conclude whether a change in the research literature can be found using
topic models.

\subsection{``Neurodegeneration'' and ``cognitive impairment'' are

research}\label{neurodegeneration-and-cognitive-impairment-are-associated-with-ad-research}}

Despite the full abstract dataset not significantly splitting into two
distinct topics, we suggested this was because the language was very
similar between the two corpses. We therefore explored the most common
n-grams frequencies. Fourteen of the fifteen most frequent unigrams were
shared between the two corpuses (Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-1}),
however there were no significant differences between the unigram
frequencies between the two time periods
(Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-4}). Similarly, fourteen of the fifteen
most frequent bigrams and trigrams were shared between the two corpuses
(Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-2}, Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-3}). This
suggested that the word usage has remained consistent and indicated that
the introduction of a novel anti-amyloid therapy may not have changed
the research landscape. We used LDA topic modelling to see whether the
terms may be distributed differently in different topics in each corpus.
Identifying ten topics per corpus and the top ten keywords per topic, we
found topics concerning neurodegeneration, study terminology or related
to AD pathology were shared by the two corpuses
(Figure~\ref{fig-topic-model-unigrams}).

\end{figure}

`\emph{Disease}' was the most frequent unigram in both corpuses
(Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-1}) and was included with
`\emph{neurodegenerative disease}', `\emph{Parkinson's disease
{[}pd{]}}' and `\emph{Huntington's disease {[}hd{]}}', which were among
the most frequent bigrams and trigrams
(Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-2}, Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-3}).
Similar topics in both corpuses were classified by terms co-occurring
with `\emph{cognitive}', included `\emph{memory}', `\emph{sleep}',
`\emph{impairment}' and `\emph{brain}' or `\emph{learning}' and
\emph{`dementia\emph{'. While '}neurodegenerative'} was common to three
topics per corpus, '\emph{parkinson's'} was the only specific disease
observed co-occurring in a topic in the earlier corpus, and none in the
later corpus. Parkinson's disease (PD) is another common
neurodegenerative disease caused by neuronal loss and affects
coordination and motor skills. The drug development pipeline for PD
contains fewer trials than for AD, however 36 new studies for PD were
initiated in the year prior to lecanemab which could attribute to its
occurrence in this topic corpus (28,48).

\hypertarget{genetic-risk-of-apoe-in-ad}{%
\subsection{Genetic risk of APOE in
AD}\label{genetic-risk-of-apoe-in-ad}}

Genetic risk as well as other AD-related risk factors were common to LDA
topics in both corpuses. The terms `\emph{genes', 'genetic}', and
\emph{'risk}' were shared by both models, however `\emph{covid}' and
`\emph{19}' were unique to the earlier corpus
(Figure~\ref{fig-topic-model-unigrams}). A genetic link has been
hypothesised between having COVID-19 and developing AD (49,50), and we
observed `\emph{covid 19}' and `\emph{sars cov 2}' were also among the
most frequent bigram and trigrams
(Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-2}, Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-3}). The
frequency of COVID-19-related n-grams was greater in the earlier corpus,
however we cannot conclude whether this is a consequence of the large
volume of COVID-19-related research published during the pandemic, or a
causal links to AD.

The rare dominantly inherited AD (DIAD) is caused by mutations in the
amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene and genes for the presenilin 1 and
presenilin 2 proteins (51). We only found `\emph{amyloid precursor
protein}' referenced in the n-gram analysis, however the gene
`\emph{APOE}' occurred in LDA topics in both corpuses
(Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-3}, Figure~\ref{fig-topic-model-unigrams}).
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the most significant risk gene for late-onset
AD and associated with age-related cognitive decline (52,53).

\subsection{Tau research may be increasing after lecanemab accelerated
approval}\label{tau-research-may-be-increasing-after-lecanemab-accelerated-approval}}

Topics containing study terminology were common to both corpuses,
however the unigram `\emph{placebo}' was unique to the later corpus
(Figure~\ref{fig-topic-model-unigrams}). The frequency of the trigram
`\emph{randomised controlled trials}' was greater in the later corpus
(Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-3}), despite fewer abstracts being in this
dataset (Figure~\ref{fig-results-summary}). This could suggest an
increase in the number of randomised clinical trials (RCT) after
lecanemab received accelerated approval . Placebos are used when there
is no known or FDA-approved therapy that can be tolerated by patients,
therefore as AD does not have a standard of care treatment to cure the
disease, a placebo may be used in RCTs. This is consistent with the
trends observed in Huang \emph{et al} (29), which suggested an increase
in Phase III clinical trials for anti-amyloid therapies in 2023 which
encompassed the traditional approval date of lecanemab by the FDA in
July 2023 from the CLARITY AD clinical trial (47).

Multiple topics in the earlier corpus referenced study terminology and
trial types, either relating to pre-clinical drug discovery in
`\emph{cells}' and `\emph{models}' or clinical studies such as
`\emph{trials}', `\emph{human}'. There were two topics relating to
treatments after the accelerated approval of lecanemab and only one
before, however language use was similar with the mention of
`\emph{drug}', \emph{`potential\emph{', and }'effects\emph{' being
observed (Figure~\ref{fig-topic-model-unigrams}). Whilst topics in the
AD literature have previously mentioned clinical outcomes (35), mention
of randomised clinical trials and placebo-controlled trials have not
emerged using LDA topic models. There was an increase in the beta-value
for the terms '}tau'}, '\emph{amyloid',} and \emph{`aÎ²'} in the topic
concerning molecular pathology after the accelerated approval of
lecanemab. Clinical trials including disease-modifying therapies
targeting tau have increased with 14 active trials at the beginning of
2023 (28), therefore research may be shifting to the other pathological
hypotheses of AD to identify treatments.

\hypertarget{immunological-and-metabolic-research-in-ad}{%
\subsection{Immunological and metabolic research in
AD}\label{immunological-and-metabolic-research-in-ad}}

As the cause of AD is not full understood, topics concerning the
molecular pathology, specifically referencing `\emph{amyloid-beta}' and
`\emph{tau}', were found and highlighted the importance of these
hypotheses. Topics concerning cellular pathology and mentioning
`\emph{migroglia}' and `\emph{mitochondrial}' may referred to the
increased neuroinflammation relating to the recruitment of immune cells
in AD (Figure~\ref{fig-topic-model-unigrams}). We also found mentions of
`\emph{oxidative stress}' and '\emph{reactive oxygen species'} in both
corpuses in the n-gram analysis (Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-2}).
Mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species and initiate neuronal cell
death in AD (54). Microglia are important as part of the innate immune
response to remove AÎ², however tau pathologies may induce an
inflammatory state in microglia causing the phagocytosis of synapses and
secretion of neurotoxic cytokines (55,56).

The term `\emph{insulin}' was only found in the earlier corpus
(Figure~\ref{fig-topic-model-unigrams}), however '\emph{type 2
diabetes'} was one of the most common trigrams for both corpuses
(Figure~\ref{fig-tokenisation-3}). AD has been referred to as type 3
diabetes due to the rapid growth of literature concerning brain insulin
resistance and experimental evidence has shown insulin sensitiser
treatments may help attenuate learning deficits (57--60). Many
epidemiological studies have suggested T2DM may be increasing the risk
of AD, leading to the lower brain insulin levels resulting in decreased
clearance of amyloid-beta (61,62). Despite this growing area of
research, observations between non-demented participants and AD patients
with T2DM have not been able to show a significant difference in amyloid
accumulation (63). Whilst we cannot conclude from our results whether
this suggests a shift in research focusing on T2DM and its metabolic
link to AD, we have observed that literature around the approval of
lecanemab does concern multiple metabolic and immunological changes
relating to AD.

An additional topic identified words relating to `\emph{AD Reviews}'
including `\emph{article}', `\emph{systematic}', and `\emph{PubMed}'
alluding to the source of the studied material. This may be derived from
only including abstract text which only provides a summary of the larger
article text. Abstract text has been used previously in LDA topic
modelling for AD research due to its concise description of only the
necessary content of the paper (36). LDA topic modelling relies on
counts of words to determine their relative abundance to the overall
text and normalises frequently occurring words (32). Further research
should replicate our methodology using full article text to ensure all
major terms are included.

Our findings suggest that the introduction of lecanemab has not had a
significant impact on the research landscape of Alzheimer's disease in
the years either side of its accelerated approval. While \emph{in
silico} methods of literature reviewing are useful to disseminate large
quantities of text data, we would suggest they are not as robust more
sophisticated text analysis methods using artificial intelligence. We do
however think that this automated approach could help provide an
overview of major topics and increase the efficiency of understanding
the large volume of studies in the AD literature. We hope this could
help in the efforts to find a cure for this devastating disease.
