TI  - Anti-Amyloid Monoclonal Antibodies for the Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 10.1007/s40259-023-00633-2 [doi]
AB  - Two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), aducanumab and lecanemab, have received 
      accelerated approval from the US FDA for initiation of treatment in early 
      Alzheimer's disease patients who have proven β-amyloid pathology (Aβ). One of 
      these, lecanemab, has subsequently received full approval and other monoclonal 
      antibodies are poised for positive review and approval. Anti-amyloid mAbs share 
      the feature of producing a marked reduction in total brain Aβ revealed by amyloid 
      positron emission tomography. Trials associated with slowing of cognitive decline 
      have achieved a reduction in measurable plaque Aβ in the range of 15-25 
      centiloids; trials of agents that did not reach this threshold were not 
      associated with cognitive benefit. mAbs have differences in terms of titration 
      schedules, MRI monitoring schedules for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities 
      (ARIA), and continuing versus interrupted therapy. The approximate 30% slowing of 
      decline observed with mAbs is clinically meaningful in terms of extended 
      cognitive integrity and delay of onset of the more severe dementia phases of 
      Alzheimer's disease. Approval of these agents initiates a new era in Alzheimer's 
      disease therapeutics with disease-modifying properties. Further advances are 
      needed, i.e. greater efficacy, improved safety, enhanced convenience, and better 
      understanding of ill-understood observations such as brain volume loss.

AB  - Epilepsy is a cause of profound disability in patients with Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). The risk of being diagnosed with AD increases the risk for epilepsy, and in 
      parallel, a history of epilepsy increases the likelihood of the development of 
      AD. This bi-directional relationship may be due to underlying shared 
      pathophysiologic hallmarks, including decreased cerebrospinal fluid amyloid beta 
      42 (Aβ42), increased hyperphosphorylated tau protein, and hippocampal 
      hyperexcitability. Additionally, there are practical treatment considerations in 
      patients with co-morbid AD and epilepsy-namely, there is a higher risk of 
      seizures associated with medications commonly prescribed for Alzheimer's disease 
      patients, including antidepressants and antipsychotics such as trazodone, 
      serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and first-generation 
      neuroleptics. Anti-amyloid antibodies like aducanumab and lecanemab present new 
      and unique considerations in patients with co-morbid AD and epilepsy given the 
      risk of seizures associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) 
      seen with this drug class. Finally, we identify and detail five active studies, 
      including two clinical trials of levetiracetam in the respective treatment of 
      cognition and neuropsychiatric features of AD, a study characterizing the 
      prevalence of epilepsy in AD via prolonged EEG monitoring, a study characterizing 
      AD biomarkers in late-onset epilepsy, and a study evaluating hyperexcitability in 
      AD. These ongoing trials may guide future clinical decision-making and the 
      development of novel therapeutics.

TI  - Passive Immunotherapies Targeting Amyloid-β in Alzheimer's Disease: A 
      Quantitative Systems Pharmacology Perspective.
LID - MOLPHARM-MR-2023-000726 [pii]
LID - 10.1124/molpharm.123.000726 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by 
      amyloid-β (Aβ) protein accumulation in the brain. Passive immunotherapies using 
      monoclonal antibodies for targeting Aβ have shown promise for AD treatment. 
      Indeed, recent US FDA approval of aducanumab and lecanemab, alongside positive 
      donanemab Phase III results demonstrated clinical efficacy after decades of 
      failed clinical trials for AD. However, the pharmacological basis distinguishing 
      clinically effective from ineffective therapies remains unclear, impeding 
      development of potent therapeutics. This study aimed to provide a quantitative 
      perspective for effectively targeting Aβ with antibodies. We first reviewed the 
      contradicting results associated with amyloid hypothesis and the pharmacological 
      basis of Aβ immunotherapy. Subsequently, we developed a quantitative systems 
      pharmacology (QSP) model that describes the non-linear progression of Aβ 
      pathology and the pharmacologic actions of the Aβ-targeting antibodies. Using the 
      QSP model, we analyzed various scenarios for effective passive immunotherapy for 
      AD. The model revealed that binding exclusively to the Aβ monomer has minimal 
      effect on Aβ aggregation and plaque reduction, therefore antibody affinity 
      towards Aβ monomer is unwanted, as it could become a distractive mechanism for 
      plaque reduction. Neither early intervention, high brain penetration, nor 
      increased dose alone could yield significant improvement of clinical efficacy for 
      antibodies targeting solely monomers. Antibodies that bind all Aβ species but 
      lack effector function exhibited moderate effects in plaque reduction. Our model 
      highlights the importance of binding aggregate Aβ species and incorporating 
      effector functions for efficient and early plaque reduction, guiding the 
      development of more effective therapies for this devastating disease. 
      Significance Statement Despite previous unsuccessful attempts spanning several 
      decades, passive immunotherapies utilizing monoclonal antibodies for targeting 
      amyloid-beta (Aβ) have demonstrated promise with two recent FDA approvals. 
      However, the pharmacological basis that differentiates clinically effective 
      therapies from ineffective ones remains elusive. Our study offers a Quantitative 
      Systems Pharmacology (QSP) perspective, emphasizing the significance of 
      selectively targeting specific Aβ species and importance of antibody effector 
      functions. This perspective sheds light on the development of more effective 
      therapies for this devastating disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lecanemab is the latest monoclonal antibody that targets beta-amyloid 
      approved exclusively for treatment of Alzheimer's disease with mild cognitive 
      impairment or mild dementia. This article aims to provide a systematic review of 
      the efficacy, and safety of lecanemab in slowing clinical decline in Alzheimer's 
      disease. METHODS: A comprehensive search of various databases, including the 
      National Institute of Health clinical trials registry, PubMed, and the Cochrane 
      library, was conducted until July 2023 using the keywords lecanemab, BAN2401, and 
      Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, conference abstracts listed in the Cochrane 
      database (including Embase) and drug information from the US Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) label were examined. Only clinical trials published in the 
      English language were considered. In total, 107 articles were retrieved, and 
      after thorough evaluation, three randomized, double-blind, multicenter clinical 
      trials involving 2729 participants were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The 
      FDA approved lecanemab for Alzheimer's disease in January 2023 which acts as a 
      novel disease-modifying anti-amyloid-beta (Aβ) human monoclonal antibody and is 
      administered intravenously. Based on the clinical trials included in this review, 
      lecanemab was found efficacious in reducing the accumulation of beta-amyloid and 
      slowing down the cognitive decline and it was well tolerated. Lecanemab had a 
      statistically significant change from baseline in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of 
      Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS), Alzheimer's Disease 
      Assessment Scale (ADAScog14), Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of 
      Daily Living Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL), and reductions 
      in brain amyloid burden. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were 
      headache, infusion-related reactions, and Amyloid related imaging 
      abnormalities-edema. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab therapy led to a substantial decrease 
      in amyloid plaques and a noticeable slowing of clinical decline. The findings 
      suggest a meaningful connection between the reduction in amyloid and the positive 
      impact on patients' clinical outcomes, hinting at potential disease-modifying 
      effects.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients who should benefit from anti-amyloid therapies (AAT) are 
      found across all geriatric settings. Yet, it remains unclear how the use of AAT 
      in patients with geriatric syndromes, such as frailty and polypharmacy, has so 
      far been discussed in the literature. METHODS: Articles on aducanumab, 
      gantenerumab, lecanemab, donanemab, crenezumab, solanezumab were retrieved in 
      MEDLINE from inception to July 2023. For each article, identified geriatric 
      relevant terms were assigned to five discussion contexts (eligibility of AAT 
      study population, safety, prescription, patient clinical profile, alternative 
      outcomes measurement). Article type and the involvement of geriatric healthcare 
      professionals as an author were further extracted. RESULTS: Out of 538 articles, 
      23 (4.27%) were published in journals from the geriatric category, 44 (8.18%) 
      included an author affiliated with a geriatric institution. One hundred and 
      sixteen (21.56%) articles included at least one geriatric relevant term, which 
      were mostly discussed in the context of safety and eligibility. Articles 
      mentioning geriatric syndromes were more frequently authored by a geriatric 
      healthcare professional (p = 0.044). DISCUSSION: The use of AAT in patients with 
      geriatric syndromes has so far received poor attention in the literature raising 
      concerns on their use in this patient group. The involvement of geriatric 
      healthcare professionals in future studies may increase the relevance of AAT 
      research in patients with geriatric syndromes.

PG  - 771-777

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lecanemab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody binding with high 
      affinity to amyloid-beta protein protofibrils. In phase 3 development, lecanemab 
      has been shown to reduce markers of amyloid in early Alzheimer's disease and 
      reduce decline on clinical endpoints of cognition and function at 18 months. 
      OBJECTIVES: To describe the health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) results from 
      Clarity AD which were exploratory outcomes in this trial. DESIGN: Clarity AD was 
      an 18-month, multi-center, double-blind, phase 3 trial. SETTING: Early 
      Alzheimer's disease. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals 50-90 years of age with a 
      diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's 
      disease and positron emission tomography or cerebrospinal fluid evidence of 
      cerebral amyloid accumulation. INTERVENTION: Placebo or lecanemab 10-mg/kg IV 
      biweekly. MEASUREMENTS: HRQoL was measured at baseline and every 6 months using 
      the European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D-5L; by subject) and Quality of 
      Life in AD (QOL-AD; by subject and proxy). Study partner burden was measured 
      using the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). RESULTS: A total of 1795 participants 
      were enrolled (lecanemab:898; placebo:897). At month 18, adjusted mean change 
      from baseline in EQ-5D-5L and QOL-AD by subject showed 49% and 56% less decline, 
      respectively. QOL-AD rated by study partner as proxy resulted in 23% less 
      decline. ZBI adjusted mean change from baseline at 18 months resulted in 38% less 
      increase of care partner burden. Individual HRQoL test items and dimensions also 
      showed lecanemab benefit. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab was associated with a relative 
      preservation of HRQoL and less increase in caregiver burden, with consistent 
      benefits seen across different quality of life scales and within scale 
      subdomains. These benefits provide valuable patient reported outcomes which, 
      together with previously reported benefits of lecanemab across multiple measures 
      of cognition, function, disease progression, and biomarkers, demonstrate that 
      lecanemab treatment may offer meaningful benefits to patients, care partners, and 
      society.

TI  - Initial Experiences with Amyloid-Related Imaging Abnormalities in Patients 
      Receiving Aducanumab Following Accelerated Approval.
PG  - 765-770
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2023.96 [doi]
AB  - Aducanumab is the first FDA-approved amyloid-lowering immunotherapy for 
      Alzheimer's disease. There is little real-world data to guide management of 
      amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), a potentially serious side-effect 
      which requires surveillance with magnetic resonance imaging. We report our 
      experiences in managing ARIA in patients receiving aducanumab at the Butler 
      Hospital Memory and Aging Program during the year following FDA approval. We 
      followed the Appropriate Use Recommendations for aducanumab to guide patient 
      selection, detection, and management of ARIA (1). ARIA-E occurred in 6 out of 24 
      participants treated; all APOE-ε4 carriers. Treatment was discontinued in 4 cases 
      of moderate-severe ARIA-E, temporarily held in 1 moderate case, and dosed through 
      in 1 mild case (mean duration = 3 months, range, 1-6 months). No participants 
      required hospitalization or high dose corticosteroids. Participants on 
      anticoagulation were excluded and no macrohemorrhages occurred. These data 
      support the measured approaches to treatment outlined in the Appropriate Use 
      Recommendations.

TI  - Principles of Design of Clinical Trials for Prevention and Treatment of 
      Alzheimer's Disease and Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline in the ACH2.0 
      Perspective: Potential Outcomes, Challenges, and Solutions.
PG  - 921-955
LID - 10.3233/ADR-230037 [doi]
AB  - With the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis (ACH) largely discredited, the ACH2.0 theory 
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been recently introduced. Within the framework of 
      the ACH2.0, AD is triggered by amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP)-derived 
      intraneuronal Aβ (iAβ) and is driven by iAβ produced in the AβPP-independent 
      pathway and retained intraneuronally. In this paradigm, the depletion of 
      extracellular Aβ or suppression of Aβ production by AβPP proteolysis, the two 
      sources of AβPP-derived iAβ, would be futile in symptomatic AD, due to its 
      reliance on iAβ generated independently of AβPP, but effective in preventing AD 
      and treating Aging-Associated Cognitive Decline (AACD) driven, in the ACH2.0 
      framework, by AβPP-derived iAβ. The observed effect of lecanemab and donanemab, 
      interpreted in the ACH2.0 perspective, supports this notion and mandates 
      AD-preventive clinical trials. Such trials are currently in progress. They are 
      likely, however, to fail or to yield deceptive results if conducted 
      conventionally. The present study considers concepts of design of clinical trials 
      of lecanemab, donanemab, or any other drug, targeting the influx of AβPP-derived 
      iAβ, in prevention of AD and treatment of AACD. It analyzes possible outcomes and 
      explains why selection of high-risk asymptomatic participants seems reasonable 
      but is not. It argues that outcomes of such AD preventive trials could be grossly 
      misleading, discusses inevitable potential problems, and proposes feasible 
      solutions. It advocates the initial evaluation of this type of drugs in clinical 
      trials for treatment of AACD. Whereas AD protective trials of these drugs are 
      potentially of an impractical length, AACD clinical trials are expected to yield 
      unequivocal results within a relatively short duration. Moreover, success of the 
      latter, in addition to its intrinsic value, would constitute a proof of concept 
      for the former. Furthermore, this study introduces concepts of the active versus 
      passive iAβ depletion, contends that targeted degradation of iAβ is the best 
      therapeutic strategy for both prevention and treatment of AD and AACD, proposes 
      potential iAβ-degrading drugs, and describes their feasible and unambiguous 
      evaluation in clinical trials.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) research has entered a new era with the recent positive 
      phase 3 clinical trials of the anti-Aβ antibodies lecanemab and donanemab. Why 
      did it take 30 years to achieve these successes? Developing potent therapies for 
      reducing fibrillar amyloid was key, as was selection of patients at relatively 
      early stages of disease. Biomarkers of the target pathologies, including amyloid 
      and tau PET, and insights from past trials were also critical to the recent 
      successes. Moving forward, the challenge will be to develop more efficacious 
      therapies with greater efficiency. Novel trial designs, including combination 
      therapies and umbrella and basket protocols, will accelerate clinical 
      development. Better diversity and inclusivity of trial participants are needed, 
      and blood-based biomarkers may help to improve access for medically underserved 
      groups. Incentivizing innovation in both academia and industry through 
      public-private partnerships, collaborative mechanisms, and the creation of new 
      career paths will be critical to build momentum in these exciting times.

TI  - Anti-Amyloid Therapies for Alzheimer's Disease and the Amyloid Cascade 
      Hypothesis.
LID - 10.3390/ijms241914499 [doi]
LID - 14499
AB  - Over the past 30 years, the majority of (pre)clinical efforts to find an 
      effective therapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) focused on clearing the β-amyloid 
      peptide (Aβ) from the brain since, according to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, 
      the peptide was (and it is still considered by many) the pathogenic determinant 
      of this neurodegenerative disorder. However, as reviewed in this article, results 
      from the numerous clinical trials that have tested anti-Aβ therapies to date 
      indicate that this peptide plays a minor role in the pathogenesis of AD. Indeed, 
      even Aducanumab and Lecanemab, the two antibodies recently approved by the FDA 
      for AD therapy, as well as Donanemab showed limited efficacy on cognitive 
      parameters in phase III clinical trials, despite their capability of markedly 
      lowering Aβ brain load. Furthermore, preclinical evidence demonstrates that Aβ 
      possesses several physiological functions, including memory formation, suggesting 
      that AD may in part be due to a loss of function of this peptide. Finally, it is 
      generally accepted that AD could be the result of many molecular dysfunctions, 
      and therefore, if we keep chasing only Aβ, it means that we cannot see the forest 
      for the trees.

AB  - Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 2 anti-amyloid 
      monoclonal antibodies, aducanumab (June 7, 2021) and lecanemab (July 6, 2023), 
      for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and will most likely also 
      approve a 3rd one, donanemab, soon. While these antibodies have been shown to 
      significantly reduce amyloid in the brain, there is little, if any, evidence that 
      they provide clinically meaningful benefit for AD patients by slowing cognitive 
      decline. I have said it before, and I say it again: the reported benefits of 
      anti-amyloid antibodies observed in clinical trials are erroneous and based on 
      misinterpretation of data and a trivial miscalculation. For example, Sims et al. 
      (2023) reported in a phase III clinical trial that donanemab treatment of early 
      symptomatic AD patients with amyloid and tau pathology provided 35% and 36% 
      slowing of clinical progression and cognitive decline, respectively, as measured 
      using the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) and Clinical 
      Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) psychometric tests. Here, in this 
      editorial, I show that 2.5% and 9.6% would be better estimates for less cognitive 
      impairment with donanemab treatment.

TI  - Eligibility Rates among Racially and Ethnically Diverse US Participants in Phase 
      2 and Phase 3 Placebo-Controlled, Double-Blind, Randomized Trials of Lecanemab 
      and Elenbecestat in Early Alzheimer Disease.
LID - 10.1002/ana.26819 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many factors contribute to inadequate diversity in Alzheimer disease 
      (AD) clinical trials. We evaluated eligibility rates among racial and ethnic 
      groups at US sites in large global multisite trials in early AD. METHODS: Using 
      screening data from 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical 
      trials in early AD, we assessed rates of eligibility among racial and ethnic 
      groups controlling for other demographic covariates. Each trial incorporated 
      positron emission tomography and/or cerebrospinal fluid to evaluate brain amyloid 
      pathology, as well as typical eligibility criteria used in early AD trials. 
      RESULTS: Across the trials, 10,804 US participants were screened: 193 (2%) were 
      of Hispanic ethnicity and Black race, 2,624 (25%) were of Hispanic ethnicity and 
      White race, 118 (1%) were of non-Hispanic ethnicity (NH) and Asian race, 696 (7%) 
      were of NH ethnicity and Black race, and 7,017 (65%) were of NH ethnicity and 
      White race. Data from 156 participants who did not fit into these categories were 
      excluded. Accounting for age, sex, and trial and using NH White participants as a 
      reference group, we observed higher probabilities of ineligibility for amyloid 
      biomarker criteria among Hispanic Black (odds ratio [OR] = 3.20, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] = 2.11-4.88), Hispanic White (OR = 4.15, 95% CI = 3.58-4.83), NH 
      Asian (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.23-4.55), and NH Black (OR = 3.75, 95% 
      CI = 2.80-5.06) participants. INTERPRETATION: Differential eligibility may 
      contribute to underrepresentation of some minoritized racial and ethnic groups in 
      early AD trials. Amyloid biomarker eligibility is a requirement to confirm the 
      diagnosis of AD and for treatment with amyloid-lowering drugs and differed among 
      racial and ethnic groups. ANN NEUROL 2023.

TI  - Immunotherapies Targeting Amyloid and Tau Protein in Alzheimer's Disease: Should 
      We Move Away from Diseases and Focus on Biological Targets? A Systematic Review 
      and Expert Opinion.
PG  - 1883-1907
LID - 10.1007/s40120-023-00541-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia 
      worldwide, making it a major public health issue. Anti-amyloid and anti-tau 
      antibodies are the most advanced therapeutic approach at present. Three drugs 
      (lecanemab, donanemab and aducanumab) are on track to be marketed in the coming 
      months. In this systematic review, we review all Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical 
      trials conducted in this indication and the particularities of the molecules 
      tested. METHODS: The PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched 
      through February 2023 for Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials involving passive 
      anti-amyloid or anti-tau immunotherapies with published results. This review has 
      been compiled in compliance with the PRISMA checklists. RESULTS: Of the 165 
      studies found and after eliminating duplicates, 40 studies had their results 
      published on PubMed and/or ClinicalTrials.gov. Eight anti-amyloid molecules and 
      four anti-tau molecules were the subject of Phase 2 studies, seven anti-amyloids 
      were the subject of Phase 3 trials, and two molecules were granted early 
      marketing approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The results were 
      compiled in summary tables showing the primary endpoints used, results, age of 
      the study population and specific adverse events for these molecules. DISCUSSION: 
      Passive immunotherapy in AD is largely dominated by anti-amyloid antibodies, 
      which are more numerous and more advanced in the pipeline. Lecanemab, donanemab 
      and aducanumab are distinguished by their relative efficacy in terms of cognitive 
      and functional evaluation but also by a decrease in amyloid and tau proteins in 
      the brain. These three molecules have in common that they bind to N-terminal ends 
      of amyloid fibrils and plaques. The findings of their studies raise the question 
      of which criteria to apply when choosing which patient will receive them when 
      marketed, such as the apoliprotein E gene's fourth allele (APOE4) genetic status 
      of patients. The large number of negative studies may also raise the question of 
      the criteria for defining the disease and the possible interest in redefining it 
      on biological grounds to offer a more personalized medicine to patients suffering 
      from neurodegenerative diseases.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia, presenting a 
      significant unmet medical need worldwide. The pathogenesis of AD involves various 
      pathophysiological events, including the accumulation of amyloid and tau, 
      neuro-inflammation, and neuronal injury. Clinical trials focusing on new drugs 
      for AD were documented in 2020, but subsequent developments have emerged since 
      then. Notably, the US-FDA has approved Aducanumab and Lecanemab, both antibodies 
      targeting amyloid, marking the end of a nearly two-decade period without new AD 
      drugs. In this comprehensive report, we review all trials listed in 
      clinicaltrials.gov, elucidating their underlying mechanisms and study designs. 
      Ongoing clinical trials are investigating numerous promising new drugs for AD. 
      The main trends in these trials involve pathophysiology-based, disease-modifying 
      therapies and the recruitment of participants in earlier stages of the disease. 
      These trends underscore the significance of conducting fundamental research on 
      pathophysiology, prevention, and intervention prior to the occurrence of brain 
      damage caused by AD.

TI  - Treatment of Alzheimer's Disease: Beyond Symptomatic Therapies.

AB  - In an ever-increasing aged world, Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents the first 
      cause of dementia and one of the first chronic diseases in elderly people. With 
      55 million people affected, the WHO considers AD to be a disease with public 
      priority. Unfortunately, there are no final cures for this pathology. Treatment 
      strategies are aimed to mitigate symptoms, i.e., acetylcholinesterase inhibitors 
      (AChEI) and the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist Memantine. At present, the 
      best approaches for managing the disease seem to combine pharmacological and 
      non-pharmacological therapies to stimulate cognitive reserve. Over the last 
      twenty years, a number of drugs have been discovered acting on the 
      well-established biological hallmarks of AD, deposition of β-amyloid aggregates 
      and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in cells. Although previous 
      efforts disappointed expectations, a new era in treating AD has been working its 
      way recently. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave conditional approval of 
      the first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for the treatment of AD, aducanumab, a 
      monoclonal antibody (mAb) designed against Aβ plaques and oligomers in 2021, and 
      in January 2023, the FDA granted accelerated approval for a second monoclonal 
      antibody, Lecanemab. This review describes ongoing clinical trials with DMTs and 
      non-pharmacological therapies. We will also present a future scenario based on 
      new biomarkers that can detect AD in preclinical or prodromal stages, identify 
      people at risk of developing AD, and allow an early and curative treatment.

TI  - Comparative Study of Safety and Efficacy of Angiotensin-Receptor Blockers and

      Systematic Review.

AB  - Amyloid-ß (Aß) plaques and Neurofibrillary tangles are hallmarks of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) pathology. Recent advances to find a cure for AD have led to the 
      exploration of Anti-Aß monoclonal antibodies and angiotensin-receptor blockers 
      (ARBs). The antibodies can decrease plaque formation or remove already formed 
      plaques. ARBs increase angiotensin II (AT2) levels and decrease the effect of AT2 
      on the AT1 receptor (AT1R). This systematic analysis reviews evidence of 
      monoclonal antibodies (Aducanumab, Lecanemab, Donanemab, and Solanezumab) and 
      ARBs in managing AD. An in-depth methodical search was conducted across PubMed, 
      Science Direct, and Mendeley. PRISMA 2020 guidelines were followed for this 
      study. Randomized control trials for antibodies and ARBs and one retrospective 
      cohort study were included. The comparison was made among studies that shared 
      similar measured outcomes. Antibodies were found to be more effective than ARBs, 
      with Aducanumab and Lecanemab being the most effective. ARBs, on the other hand, 
      were found to be the safer choice. Further trials of longer duration and larger 
      sample sizes are needed to explore both groups' long-term safety and efficacy.

TI  - Paradigm Shift: Multiple Potential Pathways to Neurodegenerative Dementia.
LID - 10.1007/s13311-023-01441-w [doi]
AB  - Neurodegenerative dementia can result from multiple underlying abnormalities, 
      including neurotransmitter imbalances, protein aggregation, and other neurotoxic 
      events. A major complication in identifying effective treatment targets is the 
      frequent co-occurrence of multiple neurodegenerative processes, occurring either 
      in parallel or sequentially. The path towards developing effective treatments for 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias has been relatively slow and until 
      recently has focused on disease symptoms. Aducanumab and lecanemab, recently 
      approved by the FDA, are meant to target disease structures but have only modest 
      benefit on symptom progression and remain unproven in reversing or preventing 
      dementia. A third, donanemab, appears more promising but awaits FDA approval. 
      Ongoing trials include potential cognition enhancers, new combinations of known 
      drugs for synergistic effects, prodrugs with less toxicity, and increasing 
      interest in drugs targeting neuroinflammation or microbiome. Scientific and 
      technological advances offer the opportunity to move in new therapy directions, 
      such as modifying microglia to prevent or suppress underlying disease. A major 
      challenge, however, is that underlying comorbidities likely influence the 
      effectiveness of therapies. Indeed, the full range of comorbidity, today only 
      definitively identified postmortem, likely contributes to failed clinical trials 
      and overmedication of older adults, since it is difficult to exclude (during 
      life) people unlikely to respond. Our current knowledge thus signals that a 
      paradigm shift towards individualized and multimodal treatments is necessary to 
      effectively advance the field of dementia therapeutics.

AB  - Recent Aβ-immunotherapy trials have yielded the first clear evidence that 
      removing aggregated Aβ from the brains of symptomatic patients can slow the 
      progression of Alzheimer's disease. The clinical benefit achieved in these trials 
      has been modest, however, highlighting the need for both a deeper understanding 
      of disease mechanisms and the importance of intervening early in the pathogenic 
      cascade. An immunoprevention strategy for Alzheimer's disease is required that 
      will integrate the findings from clinical trials with mechanistic insights from 
      preclinical disease models to select promising antibodies, optimize the timing of 
      intervention, identify early biomarkers, and mitigate potential side effects.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder marked by 
      cognitive decline and neuronal abnormalities. Current therapies address symptoms 
      without altering disease progression. Lecanemab, an anti-amyloid antibody, binds 
      to amyloid-beta (Aβ) protofibrils. Phase II trials revealed dose-dependent 
      amyloid clearance and reduced clinical decline. Phase III trials demonstrated 
      cognitive benefits with potential adverse events. Full FDA approval was granted 
      for lecanemab due to its ability to eliminate toxic brain amyloids. However, 
      longer trials are needed to assess its efficacy and safety. While lecanemab marks 
      a significant advancement, further breakthroughs are essential for effective AD 
      treatment.

TI  - Lecanemab (Leqembi) is not the right drug for patients with Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 943-947
LID - 10.17219/acem/171379 [doi]
AB  - On July 6, 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved lecanemab 
      (Leqembi) for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia (AD) patients. In 2 clinical 
      trials, lecanemab reduced amyloid in the brain and slowed cognitive decline. 
      Here, I review in detail the clinical trial by van Dyck et al. (2023) entitled 
      "Lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease", published in The New England Journal of 
      Medicine on January 5, 2023. In this 18-month trial, lecanemab did not slow 
      cognitive decline in women. This is especially significant because women have a 
      twofold increased risk of AD compared to men, that is, there are 2 times more 
      women than men living with AD. Lecanemab did not slow cognitive decline in APOE4 
      carriers; rather, it enhanced the decline in study participants with 2 APOE4 
      genes. This is bad news for AD patients, 60-75% of whom carry at least 1 APOE4 
      gene. These negative results regarding lecanemab's therapeutic value make me 
      wonder if the approval of lecanemab was the worst decision of the FDA up till 
      now, after the approval of aducanumab on June 7, 2021.

AB  - Immunotherapeutic efforts to slow the clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) by lowering brain amyloid-β (Aβ) have included Aβ vaccination, intravenous 
      immunoglobulin (IVIG) products, and anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies. Neither Aβ 
      vaccination nor IVIG slowed disease progression. Despite conflicting phase III 
      results, the monoclonal antibody Aducanumab received Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA) approval for treatment of AD in June 2021. The only treatments 
      unequivocally demonstrated to slow AD progression to date are the monoclonal 
      antibodies Lecanemab and Donanemab. Lecanemab received FDA approval in January 
      2023 based on phase II results showing lowering of PET-detectable Aβ; phase III 
      results released at that time indicated slowing of disease progression. Topline 
      results released in May 2023 for Donanemab's phase III trial revealed that 
      primary and secondary end points had been met. Antibody binding to Aβ facilitates 
      its clearance from the brain via multiple mechanisms including promoting its 
      microglial phagocytosis, activating complement, dissolving fibrillar Aβ, and 
      binding of antibody-Aβ complexes to blood-brain barrier receptors. Antibody 
      binding to Aβ in peripheral blood may also promote cerebral efflux of Aβ by a 
      peripheral sink mechanism. According to the amyloid hypothesis, for Aβ targeting 
      to slow AD progression, it must decrease downstream neuropathological processes 
      including tau aggregation and phosphorylation and (possibly) inflammation and 
      oxidative stress. This review discusses antibody-mediated mechanisms of Aβ 
      clearance, findings in AD trials involving Aβ vaccination, IVIG, and anti-Aβ 
      monoclonal antibodies, downstream effects reported in those trials, and 
      approaches which might improve the Aβ-clearing ability of monoclonal antibodies.

AB  - ARTICLE PURPOSE: The clinical approach to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
      challenging, particularly in high-functioning individuals. Accurate diagnosis is 
      crucial, especially given the significant side effects, including brain 
      hemorrhage, of newer monoclonal antibodies approved for treating earlier stages 
      of Alzheimer's. Although early treatment is more effective, early diagnosis is 
      also more difficult. Several clinical mimickers of AD exist either separately, or 
      in conjunction with AD pathology, adding to the diagnostic complexity. To 
      illustrate the clinical decision-making process, this study includes 
      de-identified cases and reviews of the underlying etiology and pathology of 
      Alzheimer's and available therapies to exemplify diagnostic and treatment 
      subtleties. PROBLEM: The clinical presentation of Alzheimer's is complex and 
      varied. Multiple other primary brain pathologies present with clinical phenotypes 
      that can be difficult to distinguish from AD. Furthermore, Alzheimer's rarely 
      exists in isolation, as almost all patients also show evidence of other primary 
      brain pathologies, including Lewy body disease and argyrophilic grain disease. 
      The phenotype and progression of AD can vary based on the brain regions affected 
      by pathology, the coexistence and severity of other brain pathologies, the 
      presence and severity of systemic comorbidities such as cardiac disease, the 
      common co-occurrence with psychiatric diagnoses, and genetic risk factors. 
      Additionally, symptoms and progression are influenced by an individual's brain 
      reserve and cognitive reserve, as well as the timing of the diagnosis, which 
      depends on the demographics of both the patient and the diagnosing physician, as 
      well as the availability of biomarkers. METHODS: The optimal clinical and 
      biomarker strategy for accurately diagnosing AD, common neuropathologic 
      co-morbidities and mimickers, and available medication and non-medication-based 
      treatments are discussed. Real-life examples of cognitive loss illustrate the 
      diagnostic and treatment decision-making process as well as illustrative 
      treatment responses. IMPLICATIONS: AD is best considered a syndromic disorder, 
      influenced by a multitude of patient and environmental characteristics. 
      Additionally, AD existing alone is a unicorn, as there are nearly always 
      coexisting other brain pathologies. Accurate diagnosis with biomarkers is 
      essential. Treatment response is affected by the variables involved, and the 
      effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease, as well as its prevention, requires 
      an individualized, precision medicine strategy.

TI  - Recombinant Antibody Fragments for Neurological Disorders: An Update.
LID - 10.2174/1570159X21666230830142554 [doi]
AB  - Recombinant antibody fragments are promising alternatives to full-length 
      immunoglobulins, creating big opportunities for the pharmaceutical industry. 
      Nowadays, antibody fragments such as antigen-binding fragments (Fab), 
      single-chain fragment variable (scFv), single-domain antibodies (sdAbs), and 
      bispecific antibodies (bsAbs) are being evaluated as diagnostics or therapeutics 
      in pre-clinical models and in clinical trials. Immunotherapy approaches, 
      including passive transfer of protective antibodies, have shown therapeutic 
      efficacy in several animal models of Alzheimer ́s disease(AD), Parkinson ́s 
      disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Huntington ́s disease (HD), 
      transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) and multiple sclerosis (MS). 
      There are various antibodies approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      for treating multiple sclerosis and two amyloid beta-specific humanized 
      antibodies, Aducanumab and Lecanemab, for AD. Our previous review summarized data 
      on recombinant antibodies evaluated in pre-clinical models for immunotherapy of 
      neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we explore recent studies in this fascinating 
      research field, give an update on new preventive and therapeutic applications of 
      recombinant antibody fragments for neurological disorders and discuss the 
      potential of antibody fragments for developing novel approaches for crossing the 
      blood-brain barrier (BBB) and targeting cells and molecules of interest in the 
      brain.

      Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - The amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ) is a driver of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ 
      monomers can aggregate and form larger soluble (oligomers/protofibrils) and 
      insoluble (fibrils) forms. There is evidence that Aβ protofibrils are the most 
      toxic form, but the reasons are not known. Consistent with a critical role for 
      this form of Aβ in AD, a recently FDA-approved therapeutic antibody targeted 
      against protofibrils, lecanemab, slows the progression of AD in patients. The 
      plasma contact system, which can promote coagulation and inflammation, has been 
      implicated in AD pathogenesis. This system is activated by Aβ which could lead to 
      vascular and inflammatory pathologies associated with AD. We show here that the 
      contact system is preferentially activated by protofibrils of Aβ. Aβ protofibrils 
      bind to coagulation factor XII and high molecular weight kininogen and accelerate 
      the activation of the system. Furthermore, lecanemab blocks Aβ protofibril 
      activation of the contact system. This work provides a possible mechanism for Aβ 
      protofibril toxicity in AD and why lecanemab is therapeutically effective.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose is to review the latest advances of brain imaging 
      for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD). RECENT FINDINGS: Brain imaging 
      techniques provide valuable and complementary information to support the 
      diagnosis of Alzheimer disease in clinical and research settings. The recent FDA 
      accelerated approvals of aducanumab, lecanemab and donanemab made amyloid-PET 
      critical in helping determine the optimal window for anti-amyloid therapeutic 
      interventions. Tau-PET, on the other hand, is considered of key importance for 
      the tracking of disease progression and for monitoring therapeutic interventions 
      in clinical trials. PET imaging for microglial activation, astrocyte reactivity 
      and synaptic degeneration are still new techniques only used in the research 
      field, and more studies are needed to validate their use in the clinical 
      diagnosis of AD. Finally, artificial intelligence has opened new prospective in 
      the early detection of AD using MRI modalities. SUMMARY: Brain imaging techniques 
      using PET improve our understanding of the different AD-related pathologies and 
      their relationship with each other along the course of disease. With more robust 
      validation, machine learning and deep learning algorithms could be integrated 
      with neuroimaging modalities to serve as valuable tools for clinicians to make 
      early diagnosis and prognosis of AD.

TI  - Unleashing the Power of Bayesian Re-Analysis: Enhancing Insights into Lecanemab 
      (Clarity AD) Phase III Trial Through Informed t-Test.
PG  - 1059-1065
LID - 10.3233/JAD-230589 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical trials targeting Alzheimer's disease (AD) aim to alleviate 
      clinical symptoms and alter the course of this complex neurodegenerative 
      disorder. However, the conventional approach of null hypothesis significance 
      testing (NHST) commonly employed in such trials has inherent limitations in 
      assessing clinical significance and capturing nuanced evidence of effectiveness 
      on a continuous scale. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we conducted a re-analysis of 
      the phase III trial of lecanemab, a recently proposed humanized IgG1 monoclonal 
      antibody with high affinity for Aβ soluble protofibrils, using a Bayesian 
      approach with informed t-test priors. METHODS: To achieve this, we carefully 
      selected trial data and derived effect size estimates for the primary endpoint, 
      the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Subsequently, a series 
      of Bayes Factor analyses were performed to compare evidence supporting the null 
      hypothesis (no treatment effect) versus the alternative hypothesis (presence of 
      an effect). Drawing on relevant literature and the lecanemab phase III trial, we 
      incorporated different minimal clinically important difference (MCID) values for 
      the primary endpoint CDR-SB as prior information. RESULTS: Our findings, based on 
      a standard prior, revealed anecdotal evidence favoring the null hypothesis. 
      Additional robustness checks yielded consistent results. However, when employing 
      informed priors, we observed varying evidence across different MCID values, 
      ultimately indicating no support for the effectiveness of lecanemab over placebo. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study underscores the value of Bayesian analysis in clinical 
      trials while emphasizing the importance of incorporating MCID and effect size 
      granularity to accurately assess treatment efficacy.

TI  - Cerebral Microbleed Patterns and Cortical Amyloid-β: The ARIC-PET Study.
PG  - 2613-2620
LID - 10.1161/STROKEAHA.123.042835 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) are associated with cognitive decline, 
      but their importance outside of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and the mechanisms of 
      their impact on cognition are poorly understood. We evaluated the cross-sectional 
      association between CMB patterns and cerebral Aβ (amyloid-β) deposition, by 
      florbetapir positron emission tomography. METHODS: The longitudinal ARIC study 
      (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) recruited individuals from 4 US communities 
      from 1987 to 1989. From 2012 to 2014, the ARIC-PET (Atherosclerosis Risk in 
      Communities - Positron Emission Tomography) ancillary recruited 322 nondemented 
      ARIC participants who completed 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging with T2*GRE 
      as part of ARIC visit 5 to undergo florbetapir positron emission tomography 
      imaging. Magnetic resonance imaging images were read for CMBs and superficial 
      siderosis; on positron emission tomography, global cortical standardized uptake 
      value ratio >1.2 was considered a positive Aβ scan. Multivariable logistic 
      regression models evaluated CMB characteristics in association with Aβ 
      positivity. Effect modification by sex, race, APOE status, and cognition was 
      evaluated. RESULTS: CMBs were present in 24% of ARIC-PET participants. No 
      significant associations were found between CMBs and Aβ positivity, but a pattern 
      of isolated lobar CMBs or superficial siderosis was associated with over 4-fold 
      higher odds of elevated Aβ when compared with those with no CMBs (odds ratio, 
      4.72 [95% CI, 1.16-19.16]). A similar elevated risk was not observed in those 
      with isolated subcortical or mixed subcortical and either lobar CMBs or 
      superficial siderosis. Although no significant interactions were found, effect 
      estimates for elevated Aβ were nonsignificantly lower (P>0.10, odds ratio, 
      0.4-0.6) for a mixed CMB pattern, and odds ratios were nonsignificantly higher 
      for lobar-only CMBs for 4 subgroups: women (versus men); Black participants 
      (versus White participants), APOE ε4 noncarriers (versus carriers), and 
      cognitively normal (versus mild cognitive impairment). CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      community-based cohort of nondemented adults, lobar-only pattern of CMBs or 
      superficial siderosis is most strongly associated with brain Aβ, with no elevated 
      risk for a mixed CMB pattern. Further studies are needed to understand 
      differences in CMB patterns and their meaning across subgroups.

LID - 10.5603/pjnns.96286 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, and its rising 
      prevalence is constantly increasing the global health burden. There are currently 
      no curative therapies for AD, and current treatment options provide only modest 
      clinical benefit. Despite numerous clinical trials, there have been no major 
      additions to the AD treatment armamentarium this century. The prevailing 
      pathomechanistic hypothesis for AD begins with abnormal accumulation of amyloid β 
      (Aβ) leading to plaque development, and disease-modifying candidate therapies 
      have largely aimed to disrupt this process. Numerous clinical trials of 
      monoclonal antibodies directed at various stages of Aβ plaque development have 
      yielded mostly negative results; however, recent results suggest that a 
      breakthrough may be on the horizon. The past two years have yielded positive 
      results for three monoclonal antibodies (aducanumab, lecanemab, and donanemab) 
      although questions remain regarding their clinical effectiveness. Additional 
      clarity is needed to determine whether the clinical benefits are great enough to 
      offset the treatment risks and the resource implications for healthcare systems. 
      This review provides a foundational context and update on recent 
      disease-modifying therapies for AD that have reached Phase III clinical trials. 
      Up-to-date information on these therapies will help clinicians better inform 
      their clinical decision-making and the counselling they can offer patients and 
      their carers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inclusions of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) has been 
      designated limbic-predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE), with or 
      without co-occurrence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Approximately, 30-70% AD cases 
      present TDP-43 proteinopathy (AD-TDP), and a greater disease severity compared to 
      AD patients without TDP-43 pathology. However, it remains unclear to what extent 
      TDP-43 dysfunction is involved in AD pathogenesis. METHODS: To investigate 
      whether TDP-43 dysfunction is a prominent feature in AD-TDP cases, we evaluated 
      whether non-conserved cryptic exons, which serve as a marker of TDP-43 
      dysfunction in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar 
      degeneration (FTLD-TDP), accumulate in AD-TDP brains. We assessed a cohort of 192 
      post-mortem brains from three different brain regions: amygdala, hippocampus, and 
      frontal cortex. Following RNA and protein extraction, qRT-PCR and immunoassays 
      were performed to quantify the accumulation of cryptic RNA targets and 
      phosphorylated TDP-43 pathology, respectively. RESULTS: We detected the 
      accumulation of misspliced cryptic or skiptic RNAs of STMN2, KCNQ2, UNC13A, 
      CAMK2B, and SYT7 in the amygdala and hippocampus of AD-TDP cases. The topographic 
      distribution of cryptic RNA accumulation mimicked that of phosphorylated TDP-43, 
      regardless of TDP-43 subtype classification. Further, cryptic RNAs efficiently 
      discriminated AD-TDP cases from controls. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results 
      indicate that cryptic RNAs may represent an intriguing new therapeutic and 
      diagnostic target in AD, and that methods aimed at detecting and measuring these 
      species in patient biofluids could be used as a reliable tool to assess TDP-43 
      pathology in AD. Our work also raises the possibility that TDP-43 dysfunction and 
      related changes in cryptic splicing could represent a common molecular mechanism 
      shared between AD-TDP and FTLD-TDP.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common chronic neurodegenerative disease 
      worldwide. It causes cognitive dysfunction, such as aphasia and agnosia, and 
      mental symptoms, such as behavioral abnormalities; all of which place a 
      significant psychological and economic burden on the patients' families. No 
      specific drugs are currently available for the treatment of AD, and the current 
      drugs for AD only delay disease onset and progression. The pathophysiological 
      basis of AD involves abnormal deposition of beta-amyloid protein (Aβ), abnormal 
      tau protein phosphorylation, decreased activity of acetylcholine content, 
      glutamate toxicity, autophagy, inflammatory reactions, mitochondria-targeting, 
      and multi-targets. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved five 
      drugs for clinical use: tacrine, donepezil, carbalatine, galantamine, memantine, 
      and lecanemab. We have focused on the newer drugs that have undergone clinical 
      trials, most of which have not been successful as a result of excessive clinical 
      side effects or poor efficacy. Although aducanumab received rapid approval from 
      the FDA on 7 June 2021, its long-term safety and tolerability require further 
      monitoring and confirmation. In this literature review, we aimed to explore the 
      possible pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the occurrence and development 
      of AD. We focused on anti-Aβ and anti-tau drugs, mitochondria-targeting and 
      multi-targets, commercially available drugs, bottlenecks encountered in drug 
      development, and the possible targets and therapeutic strategies for future drug 
      development. We hope to present new concepts and methods for future drug 
      therapies for AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Treatment options for Alzheimer disease (AD) are 
      limited and have focused mainly on symptomatic therapy and improving quality of 
      life. Recently, lecanemab, an anti-β-amyloid monoclonal antibody (mAb), received 
      accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment in the 
      early stages of biomarker-confirmed symptomatic AD. An additional anti-β-amyloid 
      mAb, aducanumab, was approved in 2021, and more will potentially become available 
      in the near future. Research on the applicability and generalizability of the 
      anti-β-amyloid mAb eligibility criteria on adults with biomarkers available in 
      the general population has been lacking. The study's primary aim was to apply the 
      clinical trial eligibility criteria for lecanemab treatment to participants with 
      early AD of the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) and assess the 
      generalizability of anti-amyloid treatment. The secondary aim of this study was 
      to apply the clinical trial eligibility criteria for aducanumab treatment in MCSA 
      participants. METHODS: This cross-sectional study aimed to apply the clinical 
      trial eligibility criteria for lecanemab and aducanumab treatment to participants 
      with early AD of the population-based MCSA and assess the generalizability of 
      anti-amyloid treatment. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-seven MCSA participants (mean 
      age [SD] 80.9 [6.3] years, 54.9% male, and 97.5% White) with mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) or mild dementia and increased brain amyloid burden by PiB PET 
      comprised the study sample. Lecanemab trial's inclusion criteria reduced the 
      study sample to 112 (47.3% of 237) participants. The trial's exclusion criteria 
      further narrowed the number of potentially eligible participants to 19 (overall 
      8% of 237). Modifying the eligibility criteria to include all participants with 
      MCI (instead of applying additional cognitive criteria) resulted in 17.4% of 
      participants with MCI being eligible for lecanemab treatment. One hundred four 
      participants (43.9% of 237) fulfilled the aducanumab clinical trial's inclusion 
      criteria. The aducanumab trial's exclusion criteria further reduced the number of 
      available participants, narrowing those eligible to 12 (5.1% of 237). Common 
      exclusions were related to other chronic conditions and neuroimaging findings. 
      DISCUSSION: Findings estimate the limited eligibility in typical older adults 
      with cognitive impairment for anti-β-amyloid mAbs.

TI  - Protein aggregation and neurodegenerative disease: Structural outlook for the 
      novel therapeutics.
LID - 10.1002/prot.26561 [doi]
AB  - Before the controversial approval of humanized monoclonal antibody lecanemab, 
      which binds to the soluble amyloid-β protofibrils, all the treatments available 
      earlier, for Alzheimer's disease (AD) were symptomatic. The researchers are still 
      struggling to find a breakthrough in AD therapeutic medicine, which is partially 
      attributable to lack in understanding of the structural information associated 
      with the intrinsically disordered proteins and amyloids. One of the major 
      challenges in this area of research is to understand the structural diversity of 
      intrinsically disordered proteins under in vitro conditions. Therefore, in this 
      review, we have summarized the in vitro applications of biophysical methods, 
      which are aimed to shed some light on the heterogeneity, pathogenicity, 
      structures and mechanisms of the intrinsically disordered protein aggregates 
      associated with proteinopathies including AD. This review will also rationalize 
      some of the strategies in modulating disease-relevant pathogenic protein entities 
      by small molecules using structural biology approaches and biophysical 
      characterization. We have also highlighted tools and techniques to simulate the 
      in vivo conditions for native and cytotoxic tau/amyloids assemblies, urge new 
      chemical approaches to replicate tau/amyloids assemblies similar to those in vivo 
      conditions, in addition to designing novel potential drugs.

AB  - In this work, we aim to capture, detect and analysis at single molecule level 
      Aβ42 aggregates. To this end, two strategies of track-etched nanopore membranes 
      functionalization were investigated. The first one uses an aptamer and requires 
      only three steps, whereas the second strategy uses Lecanemab antibodies and 
      requires six steps. Out of the two presented strategies, the second one was found 
      to be the most suitable to detect Aβ42 aggregates using a quick current-voltage 
      readout. The resulting single nanopore was then upscale to multipore membranes to 
      capture the Aβ42 aggregates before analysis through them through a 
      single-molecule approach. By comparing the species present in the retentate and 
      filtrate, we confirmed the membrane's affinity for the larger Aβ42 aggregates 
      present in the sample. We found that chromatographic membranes combined with an 
      ionic diode for binary on/off readout are powerful tools for detecting rare 
      biomarkers before single molecule analysis.

AB  - The recent positive results of phase III clinical trials evaluating the efficacy 
      of anti-amyloid antibodies in Alzheimer's disease may give hope for an 
      approbation in clinical practice soon. Indeed, lecanemab showed cognitive 
      efficacy but also on functional status, quality of life and caregiver burden in 
      the phase III CLARITY study. Aducanumab has already received marketing 
      authorization in the United States in 2021 for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
      disease. However, these clinical trials include mostly young participants without 
      significant comorbidities who are not fully representative of the real elderly 
      population. It is therefore necessary to examine the potential use of these 
      treatments in routine care in the elderly population and to identify potential 
      barriers to their use. The presence of cerebral microbleeds and anticoagulation, 
      two frequent conditions in the elderly, could limit the use of anti-amyloid 
      immunotherapy in the geriatric population. In this population, another limitation 
      would be the unusually long diagnosis delays given that the anti-amyloid 
      therapies target the earliest stages of the disease. However, the results of the 
      phase III trials and in particular the subgroup analyses seem indicate a superior 
      cognitive efficacy in elderly subjects, especially those over 75. European 
      recommendations on the future use of these treatments are therefore awaited to 
      clarify this situation, which will probably require a precise analysis of the 
      benefit-risk balance. Age alone cannot be a contraindication to the 
      administration of these treatments.

LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000207757 [doi]
AB  - With recent data demonstrating that lecanemab treatment can slow cognitive and 
      functional decline in early symptomatic Alzheimer disease (AD), it is widely 
      anticipated that this drug and potentially other monoclonal antibody infusions 
      targeting β-amyloid protein will imminently be realistic options for some 
      patients with AD. Given that these new antiamyloid monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) 
      are associated with nontrivial risks and burdens of treatment that are radically 
      different from current mainstays of AD management, effectively and equitably 
      translating their use to real-world clinical care will require systematic and 
      practice-specific modifications to existing workflows and infrastructure. In this 
      Emerging Issues in Neurology article, we provide practical guidance for a wide 
      audience of neurology clinicians on logistic adaptations and decision making 
      around emerging antiamyloid mAbs. Specifically, we briefly summarize the 
      rationale and available evidence supporting antiamyloid mAb use in AD to 
      facilitate appropriate communication with patients and care partners on potential 
      benefits. We also discuss pragmatic approaches to optimizing patient selection 
      and treatment monitoring, with a particular focus on the value of incorporating 
      shared decision making and multidisciplinary collaboration. In addition, we 
      review some of the recognized limitations of current knowledge and highlight 
      areas of future evolution to guide the development of sustainable and flexible 
      models for treatment and follow-up. As the field enters a new era with 
      disease-modifying treatment options for AD, it will be critical for neurology 
      practices to prepare and continually innovate to ensure optimal outcomes for 
      patients.

PG  - 914-931

AB  - The amyloid cascade hypothesis is a useful framework for therapeutic development 
      in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid b(1-42) (Aβ) has been the main target of 
      experimental therapies, based on evidence of the neurotoxic effects of Aβ, and of 
      the potential adverse effects of brain Aβ burden detected in humans in vivo by 
      positron emission tomography (PET). Progress on passive anti-amyloid 
      immunotherapy research includes identification of antibodies that facilitate 
      microglial activation, catalytical disaggregation, and increased flow of Aβ from 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to plasma, thus decreasing the neurotoxic effects of 
      Aβ. Recently completed phase 2 and 3 trials of 3rd generation anti-amyloid 
      immunotherapies are supportive of their clinical efficacy in reducing brain 
      Aβ burden and preventing cognitive decline. Data from recent trials implicate 
      these agents as the first effective disease-modifying therapies against AD and 
      has led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recent approval of 
      aducanumab and lecanemab, under an accelerated approval pathway. The clinical 
      effects of these agents are modest, however, and associated with amyloid-related 
      imaging abnormalities (ARIA). Testing the effects of anti-Aβ immunotherapies in 
      pre-symptomatic populations and identification of more potent and safer agents is 
      the scope of ongoing and future research. Innovations in clinical trial design 
      will be the key for the efficient and equitable development of novel 
      anti-Aβ immunotherapies. The progress in the field of AD therapeutics will bring 
      new clinical, logistical, and ethical challenges, which pose to revolutionize the 
      practice of neurology, dementia care, and preventive cognitive healthcare.

TI  - Lecanemab: Looking Before We Leap.
PG  - 661-665
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000207505 [doi]
AB  - Lecanemab, a novel amyloid-sequestering agent, recently received accelerated Food 
      and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of mild dementia due to 
      Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Approval was based on 
      a large phase 3 trial, Clarity, which demonstrated reductions in amyloid plaque 
      burden and cognitive decline with lecanemab. Three major concerns should give us 
      pause before adopting this medication: Its beneficial effects are small, its 
      harms are substantial, and its potential costs are unprecedented. Although 
      lecanemab has a clear and statistically significant effect on cognition, its 
      effect size is small and may not be clinically significant. The magnitude of 
      lecanemab's cognitive effect is smaller than independent estimates of the 
      minimally important clinical difference, implying that the effect may be 
      imperceptible to a majority of patients and caregivers. Lecanemab's cognitive 
      effects were numerically smaller than the effect of cholinesterase inhibitors and 
      may be much smaller. The main argument in lecanemab's favor is that it may lead 
      to greater cognitive benefit over time. Although plausible, there is a lack of 
      evidence to support this conclusion. Lecanemab's harms are substantial. In 
      Clarity, it caused symptomatic brain edema in 11% and symptomatic intracranial 
      bleeding in 0.5% of participants. These estimates likely significantly 
      underestimate these risks in general practice for 3 reasons: (1) Lecanemab likely 
      interacts with other medications that increase bleeding, an effect minimized in 
      Clarity. (2) The Clarity population is much younger than the real-world 
      population with mild AD dementia and MCI (age 71 years vs 85 years) and bleeding 
      risk increases with age. (3) Bleeding rates in trials are typically much lower 
      than in clinical practice. Lecanemab's costs are unprecedented. Its proposed 
      price of $26,500 is based on cost-effectiveness analyses with tenuous 
      assumptions. However, even if cost-effective, it is likely to result in higher 
      expenditures than any other medication. If its entire target population were 
      treated, the aggregate medication expenditures would be $120 billion US dollars 
      per year-more than is currently spent on all medications in Medicare Part D. 
      Before adopting lecanemab, we need to know that lecanemab is not less effective, 
      vastly more harmful, and 100× more costly than donepezil.

TI  - Hearing intervention versus health education control to reduce cognitive decline 
      in older adults with hearing loss in the USA (ACHIEVE): a multicentre, randomised 
      controlled trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hearing loss is associated with increased cognitive decline and 
      incident dementia in older adults. We aimed to investigate whether a hearing 
      intervention could reduce cognitive decline in cognitively healthy older adults 
      with hearing loss. METHODS: The ACHIEVE study is a multicentre, parallel-group, 
      unmasked, randomised controlled trial of adults aged 70-84 years with untreated 
      hearing loss and without substantial cognitive impairment that took place at four 
      community study sites across the USA. Participants were recruited from two study 
      populations at each site: (1) older adults participating in a long-standing 
      observational study of cardiovascular health (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities 
      [ARIC] study), and (2) healthy de novo community volunteers. Participants were 
      randomly assigned (1:1) to a hearing intervention (audiological counselling and 
      provision of hearing aids) or a control intervention of health education 
      (individual sessions with a health educator covering topics on chronic disease 
      prevention) and followed up every 6 months. The primary endpoint was 3-year 
      change in a global cognition standardised factor score from a comprehensive 
      neurocognitive battery. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial was 
      registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03243422. FINDINGS: From Nov 9, 2017, to Oct 
      25, 2019, we screened 3004 participants for eligibility and randomly assigned 977 
      (32·5%; 238 [24%] from ARIC and 739 [76%] de novo). We randomly assigned 490 
      (50%) to the hearing intervention and 487 (50%) to the health education control. 
      The cohort had a mean age of 76·8 years (SD 4·0), 523 (54%) were female, 454 
      (46%) were male, and most were White (n=858 [88%]). Participants from ARIC were 
      older, had more risk factors for cognitive decline, and had lower baseline 
      cognitive scores than those in the de novo cohort. In the primary analysis 
      combining the ARIC and de novo cohorts, 3-year cognitive change (in SD units) was 
      not significantly different between the hearing intervention and health education 
      control groups (-0·200 [95% CI -0·256 to -0·144] in the hearing intervention 
      group and -0·202 [-0·258 to -0·145] in the control group; difference 0·002 
      [-0·077 to 0·081]; p=0·96). However, a prespecified sensitivity analysis showed a 
      significant difference in the effect of the hearing intervention on 3-year 
      cognitive change between the ARIC and de novo cohorts (p(interaction)=0·010). 
      Other prespecified sensitivity analyses that varied analytical parameters used in 
      the total cohort did not change the observed results. No significant adverse 
      events attributed to the study were reported with either the hearing intervention 
      or health education control. INTERPRETATION: The hearing intervention did not 
      reduce 3-year cognitive decline in the primary analysis of the total cohort. 
      However, a prespecified sensitivity analysis showed that the effect differed 
      between the two study populations that comprised the cohort. These findings 
      suggest that a hearing intervention might reduce cognitive change over 3 years in 
      populations of older adults at increased risk for cognitive decline but not in 
      populations at decreased risk for cognitive decline. FUNDING: US National

AB  - In June 2021, the US Federal Drug and Food Administration (FDA) granted 
      accelerated approval for the antibody aducanumab and, in January 2023, also for 
      the antibody lecanemab, based on a perceived drug-induced removal of cerebral 
      amyloid-beta as assessed by amyloid-PET and, in the case of lecanemab, also a 
      presumption of limited clinical efficacy. Approval of the antibody donanemab is 
      awaiting further data. However, published trial data indicate few, small and 
      uncertain clinical benefits, below what is considered "clinically meaningful" and 
      similar to the effect of conventional medication. Furthermore, a therapy-related 
      decrease in the amyloid-PET signal may also reflect increased cell damage rather 
      than simply "amyloid removal". This interpretation is more consistent with 
      increased rates of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities and brain volume loss in 
      treated patients, relative to placebo. We also challenge the current diagnostic 
      criteria for AD based on amyloid-PET imaging biomarkers and recommend that future 
      anti-AD therapy trials apply: (1) diagnosis of AD based on the co-occurrence of 
      cognitive decline and decreased cerebral metabolism assessed by FDA-approved 
      FDG-PET, (2) therapy efficacy determined by favorable effect on cognitive 
      ability, cerebral metabolism by FDG-PET, and brain volumes by MRI, and (3) 
      neuropathologic examination of all deaths occurring in these trials.

AB  - The risk-benefit profile of anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) remains unclear, especially concerning their safety and overall 
      effects on AD progression and cognitive function. Here, we investigated 
      cognitive, biomarker and side effects of anti-Aβ mAbs in large phase III 
      randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) in sporadic AD. The search 
      was performed on Google Scholar, PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov by applying Jadad 
      score to evaluate the methodological quality of the reports. Studies were 
      excluded if they scored < 3 on Jadad scale or if they analyzed less than 200 
      sporadic AD patients. We followed PRISMA guidelines and DerSimonian-Laird 
      random-effects model in R. Primary outcomes were cognitive: AD Assessment 
      Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 
      Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-sum of Boxes (CDR-SB). Secondary and tertiary 
      outcomes included biomarkers of Aβ and tau pathology, adverse events, and 
      performance on Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living 
      Scale. The meta-analysis included 14,980 patients in 14 studies and four mAbs: 
      Bapineuzumab, Aducanumab, Solanezumab and Lecanemab. The results of this study 
      suggest that anti-Aβ mAbs statistically improved cognitive and biomarker 
      outcomes, particularly Aducanumab and Lecanemab. However, while cognitive effects 
      were of small effect sizes, these drugs considerably increased risk of side 
      effects such as Amyloid Related Imaging Abnormalities (ARIA), especially in 
      APOE-ε4 carriers. Meta-regression revealed that higher (better) baseline MMSE 
      score was associated with improved ADAS Cog and CDR-SB. In order to improve 
      reproducibility and update the analysis in the future, we developed AlzMeta.app, 
      web-based application freely available at 
      https://alzmetaapp.shinyapps.io/alzmeta/.

AB  - The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s recent accelerated approval of two 
      anti-amyloid antibodies for treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), aducanumab and 
      lecanemab, has caused substantial debate. To inform this debate, we reviewed the 
      literature on randomized clinical trials conducted with eight such antibodies 
      focusing on clinical efficacy, cerebral amyloid removal, amyloid-related imaging 
      abnormalities (ARIAs) and cerebral volumes to the extent such measurements have 
      been reported. Two antibodies, donanemab and lecanemab, have demonstrated 
      clinical efficacy, but these results remain uncertain. We further argue that the 
      decreased amyloid PET signal in these trials is unlikely to be a one-to-one 
      reflection of amyloid removal, but rather a reflection of increased 
      therapy-related brain damage, as supported by the increased incidence of ARIAs 
      and reported loss of brain volume. Due to these uncertainties of benefit and 
      risk, we recommend that the FDA pauses existing approvals and approval of new 
      antibodies until results of phase 4 studies with these drugs are available to 
      inform on these risk-benefit uncertainties. We recommend that the FDA prioritize 
      FDG PET and detection of ARIAs and accelerated brain volume loss with MRI in all 
      trial patients, and neuropathological examination of all patients who die in 
      these phase 4 trials.

AB  - The clinical benefit associated with anti-amyloid immunotherapies, a new class of 
      drugs for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, is predicated on their ability to 
      modify disease course by lowering brain amyloid levels. At the time of writing, 
      two amyloid-lowering antibodies, aducanumab and lecanemab, have obtained United 
      States Food and Drug Administration accelerated approval, with further agents of 
      this class in the Alzheimer's disease treatment pipeline. Based on limited 
      published clinical trial data to date, regulators, payors and physicians will 
      need to assess their efficacy, clinical effectiveness and safety, as well as cost 
      and accessibility. We propose that attention to three important questions related 
      to treatment efficacy, clinical effectiveness and safety should guide 
      evidence-based consideration of this important class of drugs. These are: (1) 
      Were trial statistical analyses appropriate and did they convincingly support 
      claims of efficacy? (2) Do reported treatment effects outweigh safety concerns 
      and are they generalizable to a representative clinical population of people with 
      Alzheimer's disease? and (3) Do the data convincingly demonstrate disease course 
      modification, suggesting that increasing clinical benefits beyond the duration of 
      the trials are likely? We suggest specific approaches to interpreting trial 
      results for these drugs and highlight important areas of uncertainty where 
      additional data and a cautious interpretation of existing results is warranted. 
      Safe, effective and accessible treatments for Alzheimer's disease are eagerly 
      awaited by millions of patients and their caregivers worldwide. While 
      amyloid-targeting immunotherapies may be promising disease-modifying Alzheimer's 
      disease treatments, rigorous and unbiased assessment of clinical trial data is 
      critical to regulatory decision-making and subsequently determining their 
      provision and utility in routine clinical practice. Our recommendations provide a 
      framework for evidence-based appraisal of these drugs by regulators, payors, 
      physicians and patients.

TI  - Alzheimer's Disease Treatment: The Search for a Breakthrough.
LID - 10.3390/medicina59061084 [doi]
LID - 1084
AB  - As the search for modalities to cure Alzheimer's disease (AD) has made slow 
      progress, research has now turned to innovative pathways involving neural and 
      peripheral inflammation and neuro-regeneration. Widely used AD treatments provide 
      only symptomatic relief without changing the disease course. The recently 
      FDA-approved anti-amyloid drugs, aducanumab and lecanemab, have demonstrated 
      unclear real-world efficacy with a substantial side effect profile. Interest is 
      growing in targeting the early stages of AD before irreversible pathologic 
      changes so that cognitive function and neuronal viability can be preserved. 
      Neuroinflammation is a fundamental feature of AD that involves complex 
      relationships among cerebral immune cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines, which 
      could be altered pharmacologically by AD therapy. Here, we provide an overview of 
      the manipulations attempted in pre-clinical experiments. These include inhibition 
      of microglial receptors, attenuation of inflammation and enhancement of 
      toxin-clearing autophagy. In addition, modulation of the microbiome-brain-gut 
      axis, dietary changes, and increased mental and physical exercise are under 
      evaluation as ways to optimize brain health. As the scientific and medical 
      communities work together, new solutions may be on the horizon to slow or halt AD 
      progression.

AB  - In randomized clinical trials (RCTs) for Alzheimer's Disease (AD), cerebrospinal 
      fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) biomarkers are currently used 
      for the detection and monitoring of AD pathological features. The use of less 
      resource-intensive plasma biomarkers could decrease the burden to study 
      volunteers and limit costs and time for study enrollment. Blood-based markers 
      (BBMs) could thus play an important role in improving the design and the conduct 
      of RCTs on AD. It remains to be determined if the data available on BBMs are 
      strong enough to replace CSF and PET biomarkers as entry criteria and monitoring 
      tools in RCTs.

TI  - Lecanemab: Appropriate Use Recommendations.
PG  - 362-377
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2023.30 [doi]
AB  - Lecanemab (Leqembi®) is approved in the United States for the treatment of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be initiated in early AD (mild cognitive impairment 
      [MCI] due to AD or mild AD dementia) with confirmed brain amyloid pathology. 
      Appropriate Use Recommendations (AURs) are intended to help guide the 
      introduction of new therapies into real-world clinical practice. Community 
      dwelling patients with AD differ from those participating in clinical trials. 
      Administration of lecanemab at clinical trial sites by individuals experienced 
      with monoclonal antibody therapy also differs from the community clinic-based 
      administration of lecanemab. These AURs use clinical trial data as well as 
      research and care information regarding AD to help clinicians administer 
      lecanemab with optimal safety and opportunity for effectiveness. Safety and 
      efficacy of lecanemab are known only for patients like those participating in the 
      phase 2 and phase 3 lecanemab trials, and these AURs adhere closely to the 
      inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trials. Adverse events may occur with 
      lecanemab including amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion 
      reactions. Monitoring guidelines for these events are detailed in this AUR. Most 
      ARIA with lecanemab is asymptomatic, but a few cases are serious or, very rarely, 
      fatal. Microhemorrhages and rare macrohemorrhages may occur in patients receiving 
      lecanemab. Anticoagulation increases the risk of hemorrhage, and the AUR 
      recommends that patients requiring anticoagulants not receive lecanemab until 
      more data regarding this interaction are available. Patients who are 
      apolipoprotein E ε4 (APOE4) gene carriers, especially APOE4 homozygotes, are at 
      higher risk for ARIA, and the AUR recommends APOE genotyping to better inform 
      risk discussions with patients who are lecanemab candidates. Clinician and 
      institutional preparedness are mandatory for use of lecanemab, and protocols for 
      management of serious events should be developed and implemented. Communication 
      between clinicians and therapy candidates or those on therapy is a key element of 
      good clinical practice for the use of lecanemab. Patients and their care partners 
      must understand the potential benefits, the potential harms, and the monitoring 
      requirements for treatment with this agent. Culture-specific communication and 
      building of trust between clinicians and patients are the foundation for 
      successful use of lecanemab.

AB  - After the CLARITY-AD clinical trial results of lecanemab were interpreted as 
      positive, and supporting the amyloid hypothesis, the drug received accelerated 
      Food and Drug Administration approval. However, we argue that benefits of 
      lecanemab treatment are uncertain and may yield net harm for some patients, and 
      that the data do not support the amyloid hypothesis. We note potential biases 
      from inclusion, unblinding, dropouts, and other issues. Given substantial adverse 
      effects and subgroup heterogeneity, we conclude that lecanemab's efficacy is not 
      clinically meaningful, consistent with numerous analyses suggesting that 
      amyloid-β and its derivatives are not the main causative agents of Alzheimer's 
      disease dementia.

AB  - Despite extensive research, no disease-modifying therapeutic option, able to 
      prevent, cure or halt the progression of Alzheimer's disease [AD], is currently 
      available. AD, a devastating neurodegenerative pathology leading to dementia and 
      death, is characterized by two pathological hallmarks, the extracellular deposits 
      of amyloid beta (Aβ) and the intraneuronal deposits of neurofibrillary tangles 
      (NFTs) consisting of altered hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Both have been 
      widely studied and pharmacologically targeted for many years, without significant 
      therapeutic results. In 2022, positive data on two monoclonal antibodies 
      targeting Aβ, donanemab and lecanemab, followed by the 2023 FDA accelerated 
      approval of lecanemab and the publication of the final results of the phase III 
      Clarity AD study, have strengthened the hypothesis of a causal role of Aβ in the 
      pathogenesis of AD. However, the magnitude of the clinical effect elicited by the 
      two drugs is limited, suggesting that additional pathological mechanisms may 
      contribute to the disease. Cumulative studies have shown inflammation as one of 
      the main contributors to the pathogenesis of AD, leading to the recognition of a 
      specific role of neuroinflammation synergic with the Aβ and NFTs cascades. The 
      present review provides an overview of the investigational drugs targeting 
      neuroinflammation that are currently in clinical trials. Moreover, their 
      mechanisms of action, their positioning in the pathological cascade of events 
      that occur in the brain throughout AD disease and their potential 
      benefit/limitation in the therapeutic strategy in AD are discussed and 
      highlighted as well. In addition, the latest patent requests for 
      inflammation-targeting therapeutics to be developed in AD will also be discussed.

AB  - Passive immunotherapy for Alzheimer disease has been tried for over 10 years 
      without success. However, in 2021 and most recently in January 2023, the US Food 
      and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval of 2 antibodies for this 
      purpose, aducanumab and lecanemab. In both cases, the approval was based on a 
      presumed therapy-related removal of amyloid deposits from the brain and, in the 
      case of lecanemab, also some delay in cognitive decline. We question the validity 
      of the evidence for the removal of amyloid in particular as assessed by amyloid 
      PET imaging, believing that what is observed is more likely a large nonspecific 
      amyloid PET signal in the white matter that diminishes during immunotherapy-in 
      line with dose-dependent increases in amyloid-related imaging abnormalities and 
      increased loss of cerebral volume in treated compared with placebo patients. To 
      investigate this further, we recommend repeat FDG PET and MRI in all future 
      immunotherapy trials.

      Incremental Step or Paradigm Shift?

AB  - The amyloid cascade model of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease (AD) is well 
      supported in observational studies. Its therapeutic corollary asserts that 
      removal of amyloid-β peptide ("amyloid") would provide clinical benefits. After 2 
      decades of pursuing the strategy of amyloid removal without success, clinical 
      trials of the antiamyloid monoclonal antibody (AAMA) donanemab and a phase 3 
      clinical trial of lecanemab have reported clinical benefits linked to amyloid 
      removal. Lecanemab (trade name, Leqembi) is the first with published phase 3 
      trial results. When administered through IV every 2 weeks to patients with 
      elevated brain amyloid and mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, lecanemab 
      delayed cognitive and functional worsening by approximately 5 months in an 
      18-month double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The trial was well conducted, 
      and the results favoring lecanemab were internally consistent. The demonstration 
      that lecanemab treatment delayed clinical progression in persons with mild 
      symptoms due to AD is a major conceptual achievement, but a better appreciation 
      of the magnitude and durability of benefits for individual patients will require 
      extended observations from clinical practice settings. Amyloid-related imaging 
      abnormalities (ARIA) that were largely asymptomatic occurred in approximately 
      20%, slightly more than half of which were attributable to treatment and the rest 
      to underlying AD-related amyloid angiopathy. Persons who were homozygous for the 
      APOE ε4 allele had greater ARIA risks. Hemorrhagic complications with longer-term 
      lecanemab use need to be better understood. Administration of lecanemab will 
      place unprecedented pressures on dementia care personnel and infrastructure, both 
      of which need to grow exponentially to meet the challenge.

LID - 100657
AB  - Lecanemab, an anti-amyloid antibody with effects on biomarker and clinical 
      endpoints in early Alzheimer's Disease (AD), was granted accelerated approval by 
      the FDA in 2023 and regulatory review in Europe is ongoing. We estimate the 
      population potentially eligible for treatment with lecanemab in the 27 EU 
      countries to 5.4 million individuals. Treatment costs would exceed 133 billion 
      EUR per year if the drug is priced similarly as in the United States, amounting 
      to over half of the total pharmaceutical expenditures in the EU. This pricing 
      would be unsustainable; the ability to pay for high-priced therapies varies 
      substantially across countries. Pricing similarly to what has been announced for 
      the United States may place the drug out of reach for patients in some European 
      countries. Disparities in access to novel amyloid-targeting agents may further 
      deepen the inequalities across Europe in health outcomes. As representatives of 
      the European Alzheimer's Disease Consortium Executive Committee, we call for 
      pricing policies that allow eligible patients across Europe to access important 
      innovations, but also continued investments in research and development. 
      Infrastructure to follow up the usage of new therapies in routine care and new 
      payment models may be needed to address affordability and inequalities in patient 
      access.

      Accelerated Approval to Aducanumab for Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - In June 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated 
      approval to aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody indicated for the treatment of 
      Alzheimer's disease. The accelerated approval decision was controversial due to 
      concerns about the use of an unvalidated surrogate measure, beta-amyloid, as the 
      basis for approval and a lack of clinical outcome benefit. Between October 2021 
      and September 2022, we conducted a survey of a nationally representative group of 
      internists, medical oncologists, and cardiologists to understand perspectives 
      around aducanumab's approval and how this FDA decision may influence trust in 
      other drugs approved through the accelerated approval program. Among 214 
      physician respondents familiar with the accelerated approval of aducanumab, 184 
      (86%) would not prescribe or recommend aducanumab. Further, 143 (67%) physicians 
      reported losing trust in other drugs approved through the accelerated approval 
      program due to the FDA's decision with aducanumab. As a growing number of similar 
      novel Alzheimer's disease treatments are on the horizon, the first of which, 
      lecanemab, already has received accelerated approval in January 2023, our survey 
      findings provide insight into the impact of the FDA's regulatory decisions on the 
      perspectives and prescribing behavior of physicians concerning these novel drug 
      treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the cognitive 
      effectiveness and safety of lecanemab on subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      METHODS: We screened the literature published before February 2023 in PubMed, 
      Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane that were searched for randomized controlled 
      trials testing lecanemab for the treatment of cognitive decline in patients with 
      MCI or AD. Outcomes measured were CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Alzheimer's Disease 
      Composite Score (ADCOMS), AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), 
      Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), amyloid PET Standardized Uptake Volume Ratio 
      (SUVr), amyloid burden on PET, and risks for adverse events. RESULTS: A total of 
      four randomized controlled trials were included, involving 3,108 AD patients 
      (1,695 lecanemab groups and 1,413 placebo groups) to synthesize evidence. 
      Baseline characteristics of the two groups were similar in all outcomes except 
      that ApoE 4 status and higher MMSE score were observed in the lecanemab group. It 
      is reported that lecanemab was beneficial to stabilize or slow down the decrease 
      in CDR-SB (WMD: -0.45; 95% CI: -0.64, -0.25; p < 0.00001), ADCOMS (WMD: -0.05; 
      95% CI: -0.07, -0.03; p < 0.00001), ADAS-cog (WMD: -1.11; 95% CI: -1.64, -0.57; p 
      < 0.0001), amyloid PET SUVr (WMD: -0.15; 95% CI: -0.48, 0.19; p = 0.38), amyloid 
      burden on PET (WMD:-35.44; 95% CI: -65.22,-5.67; p = 0.02), adverse events 
      (subjects with any TEAE) (OR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.25, 2.15; p = 0.57), ARIA-E 
      (OR:8.95; 95% CI: 5.36, 14.95; p < 0.00001), and ARIA-H (OR:2.00; 95% CI: 1.53, 
      2.62; p < 0.00001) in early AD patients. CONCLUSION: Our analysis found that 
      lecanemab showed significant positive statistical efficacy with respect to 
      cognition, function, and behavior in patients with early AD though the actual 
      clinical significance is yet to be established. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

      the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis 2.0 Perspective.
PG  - 1277-1284
LID - 10.3233/JAD-230164 [doi]
AB  - In clinical trials, lecanemab and donanemab showed statistically significant yet 
      marginal slowdown of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated cognitive decline. This 
      could be due to their sub-optimal design and/or deployment; alternatively, their 
      limited efficiency could be intrinsic. Distinguishing between the two is of great 
      importance considering the acute need of efficient AD therapy and tremendous 
      resources being invested in its pursuit. The present study analyzes the mode of 
      operation of lecanemab and donanemab within the framework of recently proposed 
      Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis 2.0 and concludes that the second possibility is 
      correct. It suggests that substantial improvement of the efficiency of these 
      drugs in symptomatic AD is unlikely and proposes the alternative therapeutic 
      strategy.

TI  - APOE ε4's impact on response to amyloid therapies in early symptomatic 
      Alzheimer's disease: Analyses from multiple clinical trials.
LID - 10.1002/alz.13128 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 may interact with response to 
      amyloid-targeting therapies. METHODS: Aggregate data from trials enrolling 
      participants with amyloid-positive, early symptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      were analyzed for disease progression. RESULTS: Pooled analysis of potentially 
      efficacious antibodies lecanemab, aducanumab, solanezumab, and donanemab shows 
      slightly better efficacy in APOE ε4 carriers than in non-carriers. Carrier and 
      non-carrier mean (95% confidence interval) differences from placebo using 
      Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were -0.30 (-0.478, -0.106) 
      and -0.20 (-0.435, 0.042) and AD Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) 
      values were -1.01 (-1.577, -0.456) and -0.80 (-1.627, 0.018), respectively. 
      Decline in the APOE ε4 non-carrier placebo group was equal to or greater than 
      that in carriers across multiple scales. Probability of study success increases 
      as the representation of the carrier population increases. DISCUSSION: We 
      hypothesize that APOE ε4 carriers have same or better response than non-carriers 
      to amyloid-targeting therapies and similar or less disease progression with 
      placebo in amyloid-positive trials. HIGHLIGHTS: Amyloid-targeting therapies had 
      slightly greater efficacy in apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers. Clinical 
      decline is the same/slightly faster in amyloid-positive APOE ε4 non-carriers. 
      Prevalence of non-carriers in trial populations could impact outcomes.

TI  - Oligomers and Neurodegeneration: New Evidence.
LID - 10.14336/AD.2023.0327 [doi]
AB  - In the last few months new results in Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease 
      (PD) have converged, attracting attention to oligomer species of misfolded 
      proteins, β-amyloid (Aβ and α-synuclein (α-Syn), in the pathogenesis. The high 
      affinity for Aβ protofibrils and oligomers of lecanemab, an antibody recently 
      approved as a disease-modifying drug in AD, and the identification of 
      Aβ-oligomers in blood samples as early biomarkers in subjects with cognitive 
      decline, indicate the oligomers as a therapeutic target and diagnostic tool in 
      AD. α-Syn oligomers were identified by new histopathological techniques in the 
      hippocampus and visual cortex of PD subjects with a distribution distinct from 
      the Lewy body pathologies but associated with cognitive impairment; these species 
      purified from PD brain were highly neurotoxic. In a PD experimental model, we 
      confirmed the presence of α-Syn oligomers associated with cognitive decline and 
      sensitive to drug treatment.

      lecanemab plus standard of care (SoC) versus SoC alone against a range of 
      willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds from a healthcare and societal perspective in 
      Japan. METHODS: A disease simulation model was used to evaluate the impact of 
      lecanemab on disease progression in early AD based on data from the phase III 
      CLARITY AD trial and published literature. The model used a series of predictive 
      risk equations based on clinical and biomarker data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
      Neuroimaging Initiative and Assessment of Health Economics in Alzheimer's 
      Disease II study. The model predicted key patient outcomes, including life years 
      (LYs), quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and total healthcare and informal 
      costs of patients and caregivers. RESULTS: Over a lifetime horizon, patients 
      treated with lecanemab plus SoC gained an additional 0.73 LYs compared with SoC 
      alone (8.50 years vs. 7.77 years). Lecanemab, with an average treatment duration 
      of 3.68 years, was found to be associated with a 0.91 increase in patient QALYs 
      and a total increase of 0.96 when accounting for caregiver utility. The estimated 
      value of lecanemab varied according to the WTP thresholds (JPY 5-15 million per 
      QALY gained) and the perspective employed. From the narrow healthcare payer's 
      perspective, it ranged from JPY 1,331,305 to JPY 3,939,399. From the broader 
      healthcare payer's perspective, it ranged from JPY 1,636,827 to JPY 4,249,702, 
      while from the societal perspective, it ranged from JPY 1,938,740 to 
      JPY 4,675,818. CONCLUSION: The use of lecanemab plus SoC would improve health and 
      humanistic outcomes with reduced economic burden for patients and caregivers with 
      early AD in Japan.

AB  - Results from recent clinical trials of antibodies that target amyloid-β (Aβ) for 
      Alzheimer's disease have created excitement and have been heralded as 
      corroboration of the amyloid cascade hypothesis. However, while Aβ may contribute 
      to disease, genetic, clinical, imaging and biochemical data suggest a more 
      complex aetiology. Here we review the history and weaknesses of the amyloid 
      cascade hypothesis in view of the new evidence obtained from clinical trials of 
      anti-amyloid antibodies. These trials indicate that the treatments have either no 
      or uncertain clinical effect on cognition. Despite the importance of amyloid in 
      the definition of Alzheimer's disease, we argue that the data point to Aβ playing 
      a minor aetiological role. We also discuss data suggesting that the concerted 
      activity of many pathogenic factors contribute to Alzheimer's disease and propose 
      that evolving multi-factor disease models will better underpin the search for 
      more effective strategies to treat the disease.

AB  - Soluble oligomers of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) have been defined as aggregates in 
      supernatants following ultracentrifugation of aqueous extracts from Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) brains and are believed to be upstream initiators of synaptic 
      dysfunction, but little is known about their structures. We now report the 
      unexpected presence of Aβ fibrils in synaptotoxic high-speed supernatants from AD 
      brains extracted by soaking in an aqueous buffer. The fibrils did not appear to 
      form during preparation, and their counts by EM correlated with Aβ ELISA 
      quantification. Cryo-EM structures of aqueous Aβ fibrils were identical to those 
      from sarkosyl-insoluble homogenates. The fibrils in aqueous extracts were labeled 
      by lecanemab, an Aβ aggregate-directed antibody reported to improve AD cognitive 
      outcomes. Lecanemab provided protection against aqueous fibril synaptotoxicity. 
      We conclude that fibrils are abundant in aqueous extracts from AD brains and have 
      the same structures as those from plaques. These findings have implications for 
      AD pathogenesis and drug design.

AB  - Amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation intermediates, including oligomers and protofibrils 
      (PFs), have attracted attention as neurotoxic aggregates in Alzheimer's disease. 
      However, due to the complexity of the aggregation pathway, the structural 
      dynamics of aggregation intermediates and how drugs act on them have not been 
      clarified. Here we used high-speed atomic force microscopy to observe the 
      structural dynamics of Aβ42 PF at the single-molecule level and the effect of 
      lecanemab, an anti-Aβ PF antibody with the positive results from Phase 3 Clarity 
      AD. PF was found to be a curved nodal structure with stable binding angle between 
      individual nodes. PF was also a dynamic structure that associates with other PF 
      molecules and undergoes intramolecular cleavage. Lecanemab remained stable in 
      binding to PFs and to globular oligomers, inhibiting the formation of large 
      aggregates. These results provide direct evidence for a mechanism by which 
      antibody drugs interfere with the Aβ aggregation process.

AB  - Host responses to anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) antibody therapy are evident in 
      neuroimaging changes and clinical symptoms in a subset of clinical trial subjects 
      receiving such therapy. The pathological basis for the imaging changes and 
      clinical symptoms is not known, nor is the precise mechanism of Aβ clearing. We 
      report the autopsy findings in a 65-year-old woman who received three open label 
      infusions of the experimental anti-Aβ drug lecanemab over about one month. Four 
      days after the last infusion, she was treated with tissue plasminogen activator 
      for acute stroke symptoms and died several days later with multifocal hemorrhage. 
      Neuropathological examination demonstrated histiocytic vasculitis involving blood 
      vessels with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Fragmentation and phagocytosis of 
      vascular Aβ were present throughout the cerebral cortex. Phagocytosis of 
      parenchymal Aβ plaques was noted. Changes suggestive of Aβ and phosphorylated tau 
      "clearing" were also noted. The findings overall suggest that anti-Aβ treatment 
      stimulated a host response to Aβ, i.e., target engagement. The findings also 
      provide evidence that amyloid-related imaging abnormalities might be indicative 
      of an Aβ phagocytic syndrome within cerebral vasculature and parenchymal brain 
      tissue in some cases.

AB  - The study recently published on the clinical effect of lecanemab in early 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) only includes patients with amnestic presentation. 
      However, a significant portion of AD patients presents a non-amnestic phenotype 
      of AD, such as primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and could benefit of rather than 
      on lecanemab. Therefore, we conducted a 10-year retrospective study at the 
      Leenaards Memory Center in Lausanne (Switzerland) to identify how many PPA 
      patients would be eligible for lecanemab. Among 54 patients with PPA, we 
      identified 11 (20%) eligible patients. Furthermore, almost half of the 18 
      patients with logopenic variant would be eligible for lecanemab treatment.

AB  - Treatments for neurodegenerative disorders remain rare, although recent FDA 
      approvals, such as Lecanemab and Aducanumab for Alzheimer's Disease, highlight 
      the importance of the underlying biological mechanisms in driving discovery and 
      creating disease modifying therapies. The global population is aging, driving an 
      urgent need for therapeutics that stop disease progression and eliminate 
      symptoms. In this study, we create an open framework and resource for 
      evidence-based identification of therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative 
      disease. We use Summary-data-based Mendelian Randomization to identify genetic 
      targets for drug discovery and repurposing. In parallel, we provide mechanistic 
      insights into disease processes and potential network-level consequences of 
      gene-based therapeutics. We identify 116 Alzheimer's disease, 3 amyotrophic 
      lateral sclerosis, 5 Lewy body dementia, 46 Parkinson's disease, and 9 
      Progressive supranuclear palsy target genes passing multiple test corrections 
      (p(SMR_multi) < 2.95×10(-6) and p(HEIDI) > 0.01). We created a therapeutic scheme 
      to classify our identified target genes into strata based on druggability and 
      approved therapeutics - classifying 41 novel targets, 3 known targets, and 115 
      difficult targets (of these 69.8% are expressed in the disease relevant cell type 
      from single nucleus experiments). Our novel class of genes provides a springboard 
      for new opportunities in drug discovery, development and repurposing in the 
      pre-competitive space. In addition, looking at drug-gene interaction networks, we 
      identify previous trials that may require further follow-up such as Riluzole in 
      AD. We also provide a user-friendly web platform to help users explore potential 
      therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative diseases, decreasing activation energy 
      for the community [https://nih-card-ndd-smr-home-syboky.streamlit.app/].

TI  - Anti-Amyloid Monoclonal Antibodies are Transformative Treatments that Redefine 
      Alzheimer's Disease Therapeutics.
PG  - 569-576
LID - 10.1007/s40265-023-01858-9 [doi]
AB  - Two anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (MABs)-lecanemab (Leqembi(®)) and 
      aducanumab (Aduhelm(®))-have been approved in the USA for the treatment of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies are the first 
      disease-modifying therapies for AD that achieve slowing of clinical decline by 
      intervening in the basic biological processes of the disease. These are 
      breakthrough agents that can slow the inevitable progression of AD into more 
      severe cognitive impairment. The results of trials of anti-amyloid MABs support 
      the amyloid hypothesis and amyloid as a target for AD drug development. The 
      success of MABs reflects a relentless application of neuroscience knowledge to 
      solving major challenges facing humankind. The success of these transformative 
      agents will foster the development of more anti-amyloid MABs, other types of 
      anti-amyloid therapies, treatments of other targets of AD biology, and new 
      approaches to therapies for an array of neurodegenerative disorders. Monoclonal 
      antibodies have side effects and, during the period of treatment initiation, 
      patients must be closely monitored for the occurrence of amyloid-related imaging 
      abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions. A successful first step in the 
      development of disease-modifying therapy for AD defines desirable features for 
      the next phase of therapeutic development including less frequent ARIA, more 
      convenient administration, and greater efficacy. Unprecedented agents make new 
      demands on patients and care partners, clinicians, payers, and health care 
      systems. Collaboration among stakeholders is essential to take advantage of the 
      therapeutic benefits offered by these agents and to make them widely available. 
      Monoclonal antibodies usher in a new era in AD therapy and define a new landscape 
      of what is possible for therapeutic development for neurodegenerative disorders.

TI  - The future of alzheimer disease immunotherapies in Saudi Arabia: Consensus 
      statement of the Saudi Chapter of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology.
PG  - 77-84
LID - 10.17712/nsj.2023.2.20220133 [doi]
AB  - Alzheimer Disease (AD) constitutes a major global healthcare problem. Standard AD 
      pharmacotherapies offer only modest transient cognitive and behavioral benefits. 
      Aducanumab, an amyloid monoclonal antibody, was the first disease modifying agent 
      to be approved for AD treatment. However, concerns about its efficacy and side 
      effects led regulatory institutions around the world to restrict its use. 
      Lecanemab was the second amyloid antibody to receive accelerated approval for use 
      in early AD. This review and consensus statement was prepared by the Saudi 
      Chapter of Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology to review the current developments 
      in AD immunotherapies from a Saudi perspective. We outline recommendations with 
      regards to offering aducanumab and other future immunotherapies to Saudi AD 
      patients. We describe resources, infrastructure, research, and clinical practice 
      changes that must be attained to transform the patient journey and clinical 
      pathways of AD in Saudi Arabia to enable offering AD immunotherapies in Saudi 
      Arabia.

TI  - Lecanemab for Patients With Early Alzheimer Disease: Bayesian Analysis of a Phase 
      2b Dose-Finding Randomized Clinical Trial.
PG  - e237230
LID - 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.7230 [doi]
LID - e237230
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Bayesian clinical trial designs are increasingly common; given their 
      promotion by the US Food and Drug Administration, the future use of the bayesian 
      approach will only continue to increase. Innovations possible when using the 
      bayesian approach improve the efficiency of drug development and the accuracy of 
      clinical trials, especially in the context of substantial data missingness. 
      OBJECTIVE: To explain the foundations, interpretations, and scientific 
      justification of the bayesian approach in the setting of lecanemab trial 201, a 
      bayesian-designed phase 2 dose-finding trial; to demonstrate the efficiency of 
      using a bayesian design; and to show how it accommodates innovations in the 
      prospective design and also treatment-dependent types of missing data. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study was a bayesian analysis of a clinical trial 
      comparing the efficacy of 5 lecanemab 201 dosages for treatment of early 
      Alzheimer disease. The goal of the lecanemab 201 trial was to identify the 
      effective dose 90 (ED90), the dose achieving at least 90% of the maximum 
      effectiveness of doses considered in the trial. This study assessed the bayesian 
      adaptive randomization used, in which patients were preferentially assigned to 
      doses that would give more information about the ED90 and its efficacy. 
      INTERVENTIONS: Patients in the lecanemab 201 trial were adaptively randomized to 
      1 of 5 dose regimens or placebo. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end 
      point of lecanemab 201 was the Alzheimer Disease Composite Clinical Score 
      (ADCOMS) at 12 months with continued treatment and follow-up out to 18 months. 
      RESULTS: A total 854 patients were included in trial treatment: 238 were in the 
      placebo group (median age, 72 years [range, 50-89 years]; 137 female [58%]) and 
      587 were assigned to a lecanemab 201 treatment group (median age, 72 years 
      [range, 50-90 years]; 272 female [46%]). The bayesian approach improved the 
      efficiency of a clinical trial by prospectively adapting to the trial's interim 
      results. By the trial's end more patients had been assigned to the 
      better-performing doses: 253 (30%) and 161 (19%) patients to 10 mg/kg monthly and 
      10 mg/kg biweekly vs 51 (6%), 52 (6%), and 92 (11%) patients to 5 mg/kg monthly, 
      2.5 mg/kg biweekly, and 5 mg/kg biweekly, respectively. The trial identified 10 
      mg/kg biweekly as the ED90. The change in ADCOMS of the ED90 vs placebo was 
      -0.037 at 12 months and -0.047 at 18 months. The bayesian posterior probability 
      that the ED90 was superior to placebo was 97.5% at 12 months and 97.7% at 18 
      months. The respective probabilities of super-superiority were 63.8% and 76.0%. 
      The primary analysis of the randomized bayesian lecanemab 201 trial found in the 
      context of missing data that the most effective dose of lecanemab nearly doubles 
      its estimated efficacy at 18 months of follow-up in comparison with restricting 
      analysis to patients who completed the full 18 months of the trial. CONCLUSIONS 
      AND RELEVANCE: Innovations associated with the bayesian approach can improve the 
      efficiency of drug development and the accuracy of clinical trials, even in the 
      context of substantial data missingness. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov

PG  - 1003-1012
LID - 10.1007/s00702-023-02618-5 [doi]
AB  - Therapeutic approaches providing effective medication for Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) patients after disease onset are urgently needed. Previous studies in AD 
      mouse models and in humans suggested that physical exercise or changed lifestyle 
      can delay AD-related synaptic and memory dysfunctions when treatment started in 
      juvenile animals or in elderly humans before onset of disease symptoms. However, 
      a pharmacological treatment that can reverse memory deficits in AD patients was 
      thus far not identified. Importantly, AD disease-related dysfunctions have 
      increasingly been associated with neuro-inflammatory mechanisms and searching for 
      anti-inflammatory medication to treat AD seems promising. Like for other 
      diseases, repurposing of FDA-approved drugs for treatment of AD is an ideally 
      suited strategy to reduce the time to bring such medication into clinical 
      practice. Of note, the sphingosine-1-phosphate analogue fingolimod (FTY720) was 
      FDA-approved in 2010 for treatment of multiple sclerosis patients. It binds to 
      the five different isoforms of Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptors (S1PRs) that are 
      widely distributed across human organs. Interestingly, recent studies in five 
      different mouse models of AD suggest that FTY720 treatment, even when starting 
      after onset of AD symptoms, can reverse synaptic deficits and memory dysfunction 
      in these AD mouse models. Furthermore, a very recent multi-omics study identified 
      mutations in the sphingosine/ceramide pathway as a risk factor for sporadic AD, 
      suggesting S1PRs as promising drug target in AD patients. Therefore, progressing 
      with FDA-approved S1PR modulators into human clinical trials might pave the way 
      for these potential disease modifying anti-AD drugs.

TI  - A Path to Improved Alzheimer's Care: Simulating Long-Term Health Outcomes of 
      Lecanemab in Early Alzheimer's Disease from the CLARITY AD Trial.
PG  - 863-881
LID - 10.1007/s40120-023-00473-w [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, 
      is the main cause of dementia and one of the leading causes of death for elderly 
      people in the USA. Lecanemab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting 
      amyloid protofibrils for the treatment of early AD [i.e., mild cognitive 
      impairment (MCI) or mild AD dementia]. In a recent 18-month phase III trial, 
      using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, lecanemab treatment led to 
      reduced brain amyloid burden and significant improvements in cognitive and 
      functional abilities in individuals with early AD. METHODS: An evidence-based 
      patient-level disease simulation model was updated to estimate the long-term 
      health outcomes of lecanemab plus standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC alone in 
      patients with early AD and evidence of brain amyloid burden, using recent 
      phase III trial data and published literature. The disease progression is 
      described by changes in the underlying biomarkers of AD, including measures of 
      amyloid and tau, and their connection to the clinical presentation of the disease 
      assessed through various patient-level scales of cognition and function. RESULTS: 
      Lecanemab treatment was estimated to slow the progression of AD to moderate and 
      severe stages and reduce the time spent in these more advanced states. In 
      individuals with early AD, lecanemab plus SoC was associated with a gain of 0.71 
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), a 2.95-year delay in mean time to 
      progression to AD dementia, a reduction of 0.11 years in institutional care, and 
      an additional 1.07 years in community care as shown in the base-case study. 
      Improved health outcomes were demonstrated with lecanemab treatment when 
      initiated earlier based on age, disease severity, or tau pathology, resulting in 
      estimated gains in QALYs ranging from 0.77 to 1.09 years, compared to 0.4 years 
      in the mild AD dementia subset, as shown by the model. CONCLUSION: The study 
      findings demonstrate the potential clinical value of lecanemab for individuals 
      with early AD by slowing down disease progression and prolonging time in earlier 
      stages of disease, which significantly benefits not only patients and caregivers 
      but also society overall. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier, 
      NCT03887455.

TI  - Design of a Non-Interventional Study to Assess Neurologists' Perspectives and 
      Pharmacological Treatment Decisions in Early Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 995-1006

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The current therapeutic landscape of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is 
      evolving rapidly. Our treatment options include new anti-amyloid-β protein 
      disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that decrease cognitive decline in patients 
      with early AD (prodromal and mild AD dementia). Despite these advances, we have 
      limited information on how neurologists would apply the results of recent DMT 
      trials to make treatment decisions. Our goal is to identify factors associated 
      with the use of new AD DMTs among neurologists applying concepts from behavioral 
      economics. METHODS: This non-interventional, cross-sectional, web-based study 
      will assess 400 neurologists with expertise in AD from across Spain. Participants 
      will start by completing demographic information, practice settings, and a 
      behavioral battery to address their tolerance to uncertainty and risk 
      preferences. Participants will then be presented with 10 simulated case scenarios 
      or vignettes of common encounters in patients with early AD to evaluate treatment 
      initiation with anti-amyloid-β DMTs (e.g., aducanumab, lecanemab, etc.). The 
      primary outcomes will be therapeutic inertia and suboptimal decisions. Discrete 
      choice experiments will be used to determine the weight of factors influencing 
      treatment choices. RESULTS: The results of this study will provide new insights 
      into a better understanding of the most relevant factors associated with 
      therapeutic decisions on the use of DMTs, assessing how neurologists handle 
      uncertainty when making treatment choices, and identifying the prevalence of 
      therapeutic inertia in the management of early AD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lecanemab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal 
      antibody that preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (protofibrils) 
      with activity at amyloid plaques. Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) 
      profiles appear to differ for various anti-amyloid antibodies. Here, we present 
      ARIA data from a large phase 2 lecanemab trial (Study 201) in early Alzheimer's 
      disease. METHODS: Study 201 trial was double-blind, placebo-controlled (core) 
      with an open-label extension (OLE). Observed ARIA events were summarized and 
      modeled via Kaplan-Meier graphs. An exposure response model was developed. 
      RESULTS: In the phase 2 core and OLE, there was a low incidence of ARIA-E (<10%), 
      with <3% symptomatic cases. ARIA-E was generally asymptomatic, mild-to-moderate 
      in severity, and occurred early (<3 months). ARIA-E was correlated with maximum 
      lecanemab serum concentration and incidence was higher in apolipoprotein E4 
      (ApoE4) homozygous carriers. ARIA-H and ARIA-E occurred with similar frequency in 
      core and OLE. DISCUSSION: Lecanemab can be administered without titration with 
      modest incidence of ARIA.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common neurological condition characterized by a 
      gradual and progressive decline in memory, language, emotion, and cognition. It 
      mainly affects elderly people. Due to the effects of AD, pharmaceutical 
      medications and anticholinesterases have been vigorously promoted and approved by 
      the FDA as a form of AD therapy. However, it was progressively found that these 
      drugs did not address the underlying causes of AD pathogenesis; rather, they 
      focused on the symptoms in order to enhance patients' cognitive outcomes. 
      Consequently, a hunt for superior disease-modifying options is launched. 
      Designing new therapeutic agents requires a thorough understanding of the 
      neuroprotective processes and varied functions carried out by certain genes, and 
      antibodies. In this comprehensive review article, we give an overview of the 
      history of Alzheimer's disease, the significance of the blood-brain barrier in 
      determining the scope of treatment options, as well as the advantages and 
      disadvantages of the current therapeutic treatment options for stem cell therapy, 
      immunotherapy, regenerative therapy, and improved Alzheimer's disease care and 
      diagnosis. We have also included a discussion on the potential role of aducanumab 
      and Lecanemab as a cutting-edge therapy in refractory Alzheimer's disease 
      patients. Lecanemab has been recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of 
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Estimated Societal Value of Lecanemab in Patients with Early Alzheimer's Disease 
      Using Simulation Modeling.
PG  - 795-814
LID - 10.1007/s40120-023-00460-1 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative 
      disorder associated with memory, cognitive, and behavioral deficits, and brings 
      significant economic burden on caregivers and healthcare systems. This study aims 
      to estimate the long-term societal value of lecanemab plus standard of care (SoC) 
      versus SoC alone, corresponding to a range of willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds 
      based on the phase III CLARITY AD trial readouts from both the US payer and 
      societal perspectives. METHODS: An evidence-based model was developed to simulate 
      the effects of lecanemab on disease progression in early AD using interconnected 
      predictive equations based on longitudinal clinical and biomarker data derived 
      from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The model was 
      informed with the results of the phase III CLARITY AD trial and published 
      literature. Key model outcomes included patient life-years (LYs), 
      quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and total costs of both the direct and 
      indirect costs of patients and caregivers over a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: 
      Patients treated with lecanemab plus SoC gained an additional 0.62 years of life 
      versus SoC alone (6.23 years vs. 5.61 years). The mean time on lecanemab was 
      3.91 years, and the treatment was associated with an increase in patient QALYs of 
      0.61 and an increase in total QALYs of 0.64 when both patient and caregiver 
      utilities were considered. The model estimated that the annual value of lecanemab 
      for the US payer perspective was US$18,709-35,678 ($19,710-37,351 for societal 
      perspective) at the WTP threshold of $100,000-200,000 per QALY gained, 
      respectively. Scenario analyses of patient subgroups, time horizon, input 
      sources, treatment stopping rules, and treatment dosing were conducted to explore 
      the impact of alternative assumptions on the model results. CONCLUSION: The 
      economic study suggested that lecanemab plus SoC would improve health and 
      humanistic (quality of life) outcomes and reduce economic burden for patients and 
      caregivers in early AD.

TI  - Learnings about Aβ from human brain recommend the use of a live-neuron bioassay

AB  - Despite ongoing debate, the amyloid β-protein (Aβ) remains the prime therapeutic 
      target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, rational drug 
      design has been hampered by a lack of knowledge about neuroactive Aβ. To help 
      address this deficit, we developed live-cell imaging of iPSC-derived human 
      neurons (iNs) to study the effects of the most disease relevant form of 
      Aβ-oligomeric assemblies (oAβ) extracted from AD brain. Of ten brains studied, 
      extracts from nine caused neuritotoxicity, and in eight cases this was abrogated 
      by Aβ immunodepletion. Here we show that activity in this bioassay agrees 
      relatively well with disruption of hippocampal long-term potentiation, a 
      correlate of learning and memory, and that measurement of neurotoxic oAβ can be 
      obscured by more abundant non-toxic forms of Aβ. These findings indicate that the 
      development of novel Aβ targeting therapeutics may benefit from unbiased 
      activity-based discovery. To test this principle, we directly compared 5 clinical 
      antibodies (aducanumab, bapineuzumab,  BAN2401, gantenerumab, and SAR228810) 
      together with an in-house aggregate-preferring antibody (1C22) and established 
      relative EC(50)s in protecting human neurons from human Aβ. The results yielded 
      objective numerical data on the potency of each antibody in neutralizing human 
      oAβ neuritotoxicity. Their relative efficacies in this morphological assay were 
      paralleled by their functional ability to rescue oAβ-induced inhibition of 
      hippocampal synaptic plasticity. This novel paradigm provides an unbiased, 
      all-human system for selecting candidate antibodies for advancement to human 
      immunotherapy.

AB  - Observational population studies indicate that prevention of dementia and 
      cognitive decline is being accomplished, possibly as an unintended result of 
      better vascular prevention and healthier lifestyles. Population aging in the 
      coming decades requires deliberate efforts to further decrease its prevalence and 
      societal burden. Increasing evidence supports the efficacy of preventive 
      interventions on persons with intact cognition and high dementia risk. We report 
      recommendations for the deployment of second-generation memory clinics (Brain 
      Health Services) whose mission is evidence-based and ethical dementia prevention 
      in at-risk individuals. The cornerstone interventions consist of (i) assessment 
      of genetic and potentially modifiable risk factors including brain pathology, and 
      risk stratification, (ii) risk communication with ad-hoc protocols, (iii) risk 
      reduction with multi-domain interventions, and (iv) cognitive enhancement with 
      cognitive and physical training. A roadmap is proposed for concept validation and 
      ensuing clinical deployment.

TI  - From attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder to sporadic Alzheimer's 
      disease-Wnt/mTOR pathways hypothesis.
PG  - 1104985
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2023.1104985 [doi]
LID - 1104985
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder with the 
      majority of patients classified as sporadic AD (sAD), in which etiopathogenesis 
      remains unresolved. Though sAD is argued to be a polygenic disorder, 
      apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, was found three decades ago to pose the strongest 
      genetic risk for sAD. Currently, the only clinically approved disease-modifying 
      drugs for AD are aducanumab (Aduhelm) and lecanemab (Leqembi). All other AD 
      treatment options are purely symptomatic with modest benefits. Similarly, 
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is one of the most common 
      neurodevelopmental mental disorders in children and adolescents, acknowledged to 
      persist in adulthood in over 60% of the patients. Moreover, for ADHD whose 
      etiopathogenesis is not completely understood, a large proportion of patients 
      respond well to treatment (first-line psychostimulants, e.g., 
      methylphenidate/MPH), however, no disease-modifying therapy exists. 
      Interestingly, cognitive impairments, executive, and memory deficits seem to be 
      common in ADHD, but also in early stages of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
      dementia, including sAD. Therefore, one of many hypotheses is that ADHD and sAD 
      might have similar origins or that they intercalate with one another, as shown 
      recently that ADHD may be considered a risk factor for sAD. Intriguingly, several 
      overlaps have been shown between the two disorders, e.g., inflammatory 
      activation, oxidative stress, glucose and insulin pathways, 
      wingless-INT/mammalian target of rapamycin (Wnt/mTOR) signaling, and altered 
      lipid metabolism. Indeed, Wnt/mTOR activities were found to be modified by MPH in 
      several ADHD studies. Wnt/mTOR was also found to play a role in sAD and in animal 
      models of the disorder. Moreover, MPH treatment in the MCI phase was shown to be 
      successful for apathy including some improvement in cognition, according to a 
      recent meta-analysis. In several AD animal models, ADHD-like behavioral 
      phenotypes have been observed indicating a possible interconnection between ADHD 
      and AD. In this concept paper, we will discuss the various evidence in human and 
      animal models supporting the hypothesis in which ADHD might increase the risk for 
      sAD, with common involvement of the Wnt/mTOR-pathway leading to lifespan 
      alteration at the neuronal levels.

TI  - Cellular response to β-amyloid neurotoxicity in Alzheimer's disease and 
      implications in new therapeutics.
PG  - 3-9
LID - 10.1002/ame2.12313 [doi]
AB  - β-Amyloid (Aβ) is a specific pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
      Because of its neurotoxicity, AD patients exhibit multiple brain dysfunctions. 
      Disease-modifying therapy (DMT) is the central concept in the development of AD 
      therapeutics today, and most DMT drugs that are currently in clinical trials are 
      anti-Aβ drugs, such as aducanumab and lecanemab. Therefore, understanding Aβ's 
      neurotoxic mechanism is crucial for Aβ-targeted drug development. Despite its 
      total length of only a few dozen amino acids, Aβ is incredibly diverse. In 
      addition to the well-known Aβ(1-42) , N-terminally truncated, glutaminyl cyclase 
      (QC) catalyzed, and pyroglutamate-modified Aβ (pEAβ) is also highly amyloidogenic 
      and far more cytotoxic. The extracellular monomeric Aβ(x-42) (x = 1-11) initiates 
      the aggregation to form fibrils and plaques and causes many abnormal cellular 
      responses through cell membrane receptors and receptor-coupled signal pathways. 
      These signal cascades further influence many cellular metabolism-related 
      processes, such as gene expression, cell cycle, and cell fate, and ultimately 
      cause severe neural cell damage. However, endogenous cellular anti-Aβ defense 
      processes always accompany the Aβ-induced microenvironment alterations. 
      Aβ-cleaving endopeptidases, Aβ-degrading ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), and 
      Aβ-engulfing glial cell immune responses are all essential self-defense 
      mechanisms that we can leverage to develop new drugs. This review discusses some 
      of the most recent advances in understanding Aβ-centric AD mechanisms and 
      suggests prospects for promising anti-Aβ strategies.

AB  - Lecanemab (lecanemab-irmb; LEQEMBI™) is a humanized immunoglobulin gamma 1 (IgG1) 
      against aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid-β peptide. It is being 
      developed by Eisai, under a global licence from BioArctic (formerly BioArctic 
      Neuroscience), and in collaboration with Biogen, for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
      disease, and received its first approval for this indication on 6 January 2023 in 
      the USA under the Accelerated Approval Pathway. According to the US prescribing 
      information, treatment should be initiated in patients with mild cognitive 
      impairment or mild dementia stage of disease, and a confirmed presence of amyloid 
      beta pathology (i.e. the population in which treatment was initiated in clinical 
      trials). There are no effectiveness or safety data on initiating treatment at 
      earlier or later stages of the disease than were studied. Lecanemab is undergoing 
      regulatory review in the EU, Japan and China, with clinical development underway 
      in several other countries worldwide. This article summarizes the milestones in 
      the development of lecanemab leading to this first approval for the treatment of 
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Playing Russian Roulette with Alzheimer's Disease Patients: Do the Cognitive 
      Benefits of Lecanemab Outweigh the Risk of Edema, Stroke and Encephalitis?
PG  - 799-801
LID - 10.3233/JAD-230040 [doi]
AB  - The questionable approval of aducanumab and the recent approval of lecanemab 
      (Leqembi; Eisai and Biogen) by the FDA has raised the issue of safety (stroke, 
      meningitis, and encephalitis) over efficacy (slowing of cognitive decline). This 
      communication recounts the important physiological functions of amyloid-β as a 
      barrier protein with unique sealant and anti-pathogenic activities important for 
      maintaining vascular integrity coupled with innate immune functions that prevent 
      encephalitis and meningitis. The approval of a drug that obviates both of these 
      purposive functions increases the risk of hemorrhage, edema and downstream 
      pathogenic outcomes and should be clearly outlined to patients.

TI  - White matter injury, cholesterol dysmetabolism, and APP/Abeta dysmetabolism 
      interact to produce Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology: A hypothesis and 
      review.
PG  - 1096206
LID - 10.3389/fnagi.2023.1096206 [doi]
LID - 1096206
AB  - We postulate that myelin injury contributes to cholesterol release from myelin 
      and cholesterol dysmetabolism which contributes to Abeta dysmetabolism, and 
      combined with genetic and AD risk factors, leads to increased Abeta and amyloid 
      plaques. Increased Abeta damages myelin to form a vicious injury cycle. Thus, 
      white matter injury, cholesterol dysmetabolism and Abeta dysmetabolism interact 
      to produce or worsen AD neuropathology. The amyloid cascade is the leading 
      hypothesis for the cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The failure of clinical 
      trials based on this hypothesis has raised other possibilities. Even with a 
      possible new success (Lecanemab), it is not clear whether this is a cause or a 
      result of the disease. With the discovery in 1993 that the apolipoprotein E type 
      4 allele (APOE4) was the major risk factor for sporadic, late-onset AD (LOAD), 
      there has been increasing interest in cholesterol in AD since APOE is a major 
      cholesterol transporter. Recent studies show that cholesterol metabolism is 
      intricately involved with Abeta (Aβ)/amyloid transport and metabolism, with 
      cholesterol down-regulating the Aβ LRP1 transporter and upregulating the Aβ RAGE 
      receptor, both of which would increase brain Aβ. Moreover, manipulating 
      cholesterol transport and metabolism in rodent AD models can ameliorate pathology 
      and cognitive deficits, or worsen them depending upon the manipulation. Though 
      white matter (WM) injury has been noted in AD brain since Alzheimer's initial 
      observations, recent studies have shown abnormal white matter in every AD brain. 
      Moreover, there is age-related WM injury in normal individuals that occurs 
      earlier and is worse with the APOE4 genotype. Moreover, WM injury precedes 
      formation of plaques and tangles in human Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) and 
      precedes plaque formation in rodent AD models. Restoring WM in rodent AD models 
      improves cognition without affecting AD pathology. Thus, we postulate that the 
      amyloid cascade, cholesterol dysmetabolism and white matter injury interact to 
      produce and/or worsen AD pathology. We further postulate that the primary 
      initiating event could be related to any of the three, with age a major factor 
      for WM injury, diet and APOE4 and other genes a factor for cholesterol 
      dysmetabolism, and FAD and other genes for Abeta dysmetabolism.

AB  - Recent observations from clinical trials using monoclonal antibodies against Aβ 
      seem to suggest that Aβ-targeting is modestly effective and not sufficiently 
      based on an effective challenge of the role of Aβ from physiological to 
      pathological. After an accelerated approval procedure for aducanumab, and more 
      recently lecanemab, their efficacy and safety remain to be fully defined despite 
      previous attempts with various monoclonal antibodies, and both academic 
      institutions and pharmaceutical companies are actively searching for novel 
      treatments. Aβ needs to be clarified further in a more complicated context, 
      taking into account both its accumulation and its biological functions during the 
      course of the disease. In this review, we discuss the border between activities 
      affecting early, potentially reversible dysfunctions of the synapse and events 
      trespassing the threshold of inflammatory, self-sustaining glial activation, 
      leading to irreversible damage. We detail a clear understanding of the biological 
      mechanisms underlying the derangement from function to dysfunction and the switch 
      of the of Aβ role from physiological to pathological. A picture is emerging where 
      the optimal therapeutic strategy against AD should involve a number of allied 
      molecular processes, displaying efficacy not only in reducing the well-known AD 
      pathogenesis players, such as Aβ or neuroinflammation, but also in preventing 
      their adverse effects.

TI  - Predicting amyloid PET and tau PET stages with plasma biomarkers.
PG  - 2029-2044
LID - 10.1093/brain/awad042 [doi]
AB  - Staging the severity of Alzheimer's disease pathology using biomarkers is useful 
      for therapeutic trials and clinical prognosis. Disease staging with amyloid and 
      tau PET has face validity; however, this would be more practical with plasma 
      biomarkers. Our objectives were, first, to examine approaches for staging amyloid 
      and tau PET and, second, to examine prediction of amyloid and tau PET stages 
      using plasma biomarkers. Participants (n = 1136) were enrolled in either the Mayo 
      Clinic Study of Aging or the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center; had a 
      concurrent amyloid PET, tau PET and blood draw; and met clinical criteria for 
      cognitively unimpaired (n = 864), mild cognitive impairment (n = 148) or 
      Alzheimer's clinical syndrome with dementia (n = 124). The latter two groups were 
      combined into a cognitively impaired group (n = 272). We used multinomial 
      regression models to estimate discrimination [concordance (C) statistics] among 
      three amyloid PET stages (low, intermediate, high), four tau PET stages (Braak 0, 
      1-2, 3-4, 5-6) and a combined amyloid and tau PET stage (none/low versus 
      intermediate/high severity) using plasma biomarkers as predictors separately 
      within unimpaired and impaired individuals. Plasma analytes, p-tau181, Aβ1-42 and 
      Aβ1-40 (analysed as the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio), glial fibrillary acidic protein and 
      neurofilament light chain were measured on the HD-X Simoa Quanterix platform. 
      Plasma p-tau217 was also measured in a subset (n = 355) of cognitively unimpaired 
      participants using the Lilly Meso Scale Discovery assay. Models with all 
      Quanterix plasma analytes along with risk factors (age, sex and APOE) most often 
      provided the best discrimination among amyloid PET stages (C = 0.78-0.82). Models 
      with p-tau181 provided similar discrimination of tau PET stages to models with 
      all four plasma analytes (C = 0.72-0.85 versus C = 0.73-0.86). Discriminating a 
      PET proxy of intermediate/high from none/low Alzheimer's disease 
      neuropathological change with all four Quanterix plasma analytes was excellent 
      but not better than p-tau181 only (C = 0.88 versus 0.87 for unimpaired and C = 
      0.91 versus 0.90 for impaired). Lilly p-tau217 outperformed the Quanterix 
      p-tau181 assay for discriminating high versus intermediate amyloid (C = 0.85 
      versus 0.74) but did not improve over a model with all Quanterix plasma analytes 
      and risk factors (C = 0.85 versus 0.83). Plasma analytes along with risk factors 
      can discriminate between amyloid and tau PET stages and between a PET surrogate 
      for intermediate/high versus none/low neuropathological change with accuracy in 
      the acceptable to excellent range. Combinations of plasma analytes are better 
      than single analytes for many staging predictions with the exception that 
      Quanterix p-tau181 alone usually performed equivalently to combinations of 
      Quanterix analytes for tau PET discrimination.

TI  - The Pursuit of the "Inside" of the Amyloid Hypothesis-Is C99 a Promising 
      Therapeutic Target for Alzheimer's Disease?
LID - 10.3390/cells12030454 [doi]
LID - 454
AB  - Aducanumab, co-developed by Eisai (Japan) and Biogen (U.S.), has received Food 
      and Drug Administration approval for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). In 
      addition, its successor antibody, lecanemab, has been approved. These antibodies 
      target the aggregated form of the small peptide, amyloid-β (Aβ), which 
      accumulates in the patient brain. The "amyloid hypothesis" based therapy that 
      places the aggregation and toxicity of Aβ at the center of the etiology is about 
      to be realized. However, the effects of immunotherapy are still limited, 
      suggesting the need to reconsider this hypothesis. Aβ is produced from a type-I 
      transmembrane protein, Aβ precursor protein (APP). One of the APP metabolites, 
      the 99-amino acids C-terminal fragment (C99, also called βCTF), is a direct 
      precursor of Aβ and accumulates in the AD patient's brain to demonstrate toxicity 
      independent of Aβ. Conventional drug discovery strategies have focused on Aβ 
      toxicity on the "outside" of the neuron, but C99 accumulation might explain the 
      toxicity on the "inside" of the neuron, which was overlooked in the hypothesis. 
      Furthermore, the common region of C99 and Aβ is a promising target for 
      multifunctional AD drugs. This review aimed to outline the nature, metabolism, 
      and impact of C99 on AD pathogenesis and discuss whether it could be a 
      therapeutic target complementing the amyloid hypothesis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nearly a dozen monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against 
      beta-amyloid (Aβ) have been developed for the treatment of Alzheimer disease 
      (AD), and most of these mAbs are undergoing clinical trials. Newer mAbs have 
      targeted more specific Aβ types. Lecanemab Eisai has a high affinity for large 
      and soluble Aβ protofibrils. Data from phase 2 clinical trials have suggested the 
      possibility of a robust efficacy signal and manageable risk of amyloid-related 
      imaging abnormalities (ARIAs). Lecanemab is currently being studied in phase 3 
      trials. AREAS COVERED: This article briefly reviews mAbs that target Aβ in AD and 
      discusses the biology, mechanism of action, and targets of lecanemab. EXPERT 
      OPINION: mAbs that target Aβ are an important focus of therapeutic development 
      for AD, with several soon to be considered for US Food and Drug Administration 
      approval. The experience of aducanumab informs the development of other mAbs, 
      such as lecanemab. One consideration is the conformation of Aβ targets. Targeting 
      monomeric species has not resulted in robust clinical efficacy, whereas targeting 
      Aβ in the form of oligomers, protofibrils, and plaques has shown evidence of 
      slowing clinical decline. Another consideration is that mAbs will require safety 
      monitoring for ARIAs.

TI  - A combined physiologically-based pharmacokinetic and quantitative systems 
      pharmacology model for modeling amyloid aggregation in Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 444-461
LID - 10.1002/psp4.12912 [doi]
AB  - Antibody-mediated removal of aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) is the current, most 
      clinically advanced potential disease-modifying treatment approach for 
      Alzheimer's disease. We describe a quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) 
      approach of the dynamics of Aβ monomers, oligomers, protofibrils, and plaque 
      using a detailed microscopic model of Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) aggregation and clearance 
      of aggregated Aβ by activated microglia cells, which is enhanced by the 
      interaction of antibody-bound Aβ. The model allows for the prediction of Aβ 
      positron emission tomography (PET) imaging load as measured by a standardized 
      uptake value ratio. A physiology-based pharmacokinetic model is seamlessly 
      integrated to describe target exposure of monoclonal antibodies and simulate 
      dynamics of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma biomarkers, including CSF Aβ(42) 
      and plasma Aβ(42) /Aβ(40) ratio biomarkers. Apolipoprotein E genotype is 
      implemented as a difference in microglia clearance. By incorporating 
      antibody-bound, plaque-mediated macrophage activation in the perivascular 
      compartment, the model also predicts the incidence of amyloid-related imaging 
      abnormalities with edema (ARIA-E). The QSP platform is calibrated with 
      pharmacological and clinical information on aducanumab, bapineuzumab, crenezumab, 
      gantenerumab, lecanemab, and solanezumab, predicting adequately the change in PET 
      imaging measured amyloid load and the changes in the plasma Aβ(42) /Aβ(40) ratio 
      while slightly overestimating the change in CSF Aβ(42) . ARIA-E is well predicted 
      for all antibodies except bapineuzumab. This QSP model could support the clinical 
      trial design of different amyloid-modulating interventions, define optimal 
      titration and maintenance schedules, and provide a first step to understand the 
      variability of biomarker response in clinical practice.

TI  - Role of monomeric amyloid-β in cognitive performance in Alzheimer's disease: 
      Insights from clinical trials with secretase inhibitors and monoclonal 
      antibodies.

AB  - According to the β-amyloid (Aβ) hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), brain Aβ 
      accumulation is the primary cascade event leading to cognitive deficit and 
      dementia. Numerous anti-Aβ drugs either inhibiting production or aggregation of 
      Aβ or stimulating its clearance have failed to show clinical benefit in large 
      scale AD trials, with β- and γ-secretase inhibitors consistently worsening 
      cognitive and clinical decline. In June 2021, the FDA approved aducanumab, an 
      anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody for early AD based on its ability to reduce brain 
      amyloid plaques, while two other amyloid-clearing antibodies (lecanemab and 
      donanemab) have recently produced encouraging cognitive and clinical results. We 
      reviewed AD trials using PubMed, meeting abstracts and ClinicalTrials.gov and 
      evaluated the effects of such drugs on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ levels, 
      correlating them with cognitive effects. We found that β-secretase and 
      γ-secretase inhibitors produce detrimental cognitive effects by significantly 
      reducing CSF Aβ levels. We speculate that monoclonal antibodies targeting Aβ 
      protofibrils, fibrils or plaques may improve cognitive performance in early AD by 
      increasing soluble Aβ levels through Aβ aggregate disassembly and/or 
      stabilization of existing Aβ monomers.These findings suggest that the real 
      culprit in AD may be decreased levels of soluble monomeric Aβ due to 
      sequestration into brain Aβ aggregates and plaques.

TI  - Lecanemab in patients with early Alzheimer's disease: detailed results on

      extension of the phase 2 proof-of-concept study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets soluble 
      aggregated Aβ species (protofibrils), has demonstrated robust brain fibrillar 
      amyloid reduction and slowing of clinical decline in early AD. The objective of 
      this analysis is to report results from study 201 blinded period (core), the 
      open-label extension (OLE), and gap period (between core and OLE) supporting the 
      effectiveness of lecanemab. METHODS: The lecanemab study 201 core was a 
      double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of 856 patients randomized to 
      one of five dose regimens or placebo. An OLE of study 201 was initiated to allow 
      patients to receive open-label lecanemab 10mg/kg biweekly for up to 24 months, 
      with an intervening off-treatment period (gap period) ranging from 9 to 59 months 
      (mean 24 months). RESULTS: At 12 and 18 months of treatment in the core, 
      lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly demonstrated dose-dependent reductions of brain 
      amyloid measured PET and corresponding changes in plasma biomarkers and slowing 
      of cognitive decline. The rates of clinical progression during the gap were 
      similar in lecanemab and placebo subjects, with clinical treatment differences 
      maintained after discontinued dosing over an average of 24 months in the gap 
      period. During the gap, plasma Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau181 levels began to return 
      towards pre-randomization levels more quickly than amyloid PET. At OLE baseline, 
      treatment differences vs placebo at 18 months in the randomized period were 
      maintained across 3 clinical assessments. In the OLE, lecanemab 10 mg/kg biweekly 
      treatment produced dose-dependent reductions in amyloid PET SUVr, improvements in 
      plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, and reductions in plasma p-tau181. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab 
      treatment resulted in significant reduction in amyloid plaques and a slowing of 
      clinical decline. Data indicate that rapid and pronounced amyloid reduction 
      correlates with clinical benefit and potential disease-modifying effects, as well 
      as the potential to use plasma biomarkers to monitor for lecanemab treatment 
      effects. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01767311 .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lecanemab (BAN2401) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that 
      preferentially targets soluble aggregated Aβ species (protofibrils) with activity 
      at insoluble fibrils and slowed clinical decline in an 18-month phase 2 
      proof-of-concept study (Study 201; ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01767311) in 856 
      subjects with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this trial, subjects were 
      randomized to five lecanemab dose regimens or placebo. The primary efficacy 
      endpoint was change from baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score 
      (ADCOMS) at 12 months with Bayesian analyses. The key secondary endpoints were 
      ADCOMS at 18 months and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB) and 
      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14) at 18 
      months. The results have been published previously. Herein, we describe the 
      results of sensitivity analyses evaluating the consistency of the lecanemab 
      efficacy results in Study 201 at the identified dose, the ED90, across multiple 
      statistical methods and multiple endpoints over the duration of the study. 
      METHODS: The protocol-specified analysis model was a mixed model for repeated 
      measures (MMRM). Sensitivity analyses address the consistency of the conclusions 
      using multiple statistical methods. These include a disease progression model 
      (DPM), a natural cubic spline (NCS) model, a quadratic mixed model (QMM), and 2 
      MMRMs with additional covariates. RESULTS: The sensitivity analyses showed 
      positive lecanemab treatment effects for all endpoints and all statistical models 
      considered. The protocol-specified ADCOMS analysis showed a 29.7% slower decline 
      than placebo for ADCOMS at 18 months. The various other analyses of 3 key 
      endpoints showed declines ranging from 26.5 to 55.9%. The results at 12 months 
      are also consistent with those at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: The conclusion of the 
      primary analysis of the lecanemab Study 201 is strengthened by the consistently 
      positive conclusions across multiple statistical models, across efficacy 
      endpoints, and over time, despite missing data. The 18-month data from this trial 
      was utilized in the design of the confirmatory phase 3 trial (Clarity AD) and 
      allowed for proper powering for multiple, robust outcomes.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease. Prior to 2017, 
      National Medical Products Administration approved only four drugs to treat 
      Alzheimer's disease, including three cholinesterase inhibitors and one 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist. We queried ClinicalTrials.gov to better 
      understand Alzheimer's drug development over the past 5 years and found 16 
      promising candidates that have entered late-stage trials and analyzed their 
      impact on clinical treatment of Alzheimer's disease in China. The 16 compounds 
      selected include disease-modifying therapies and symptomatic therapies. The 
      research and development pipeline now focuses on disease-modifying therapies such 
      as gantenerumab, aducanumab, ALZ-801, ALZT-OP1, donanemab, lecanemab, simufilam, 
      NE3107, semaglutide, and GV-971, which could put an end to the situation where 
      Alzheimer's patients in China have no effective treatment alternatives. The reuse 
      of drugs or combinations currently under investigation for the psychiatric 
      treatment of Alzheimer's disease, including AXS-05, AVP-786, nabilone, 
      brexpiprazole, methylphenidate, and pimavanserin, could provide physicians with 
      additional treatment options. Although most of these drugs have not been explored 
      in China yet, due to the current development trend in this field in China, it is 
      expected that China will be involved in research on these drugs in the future.

TI  - Development of a quantitative semi-mechanistic model of Alzheimer's disease based

PG  - 2287-2297

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A quantitative model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) based on the 
      amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration biomarker framework (Q-ATN model) was developed to 
      sequentially link amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, medial 
      temporal cortical thickness, and clinical outcome (Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum 
      of Boxes; CDR-SB). METHODS: Published data and biologically plausible mechanisms 
      were used to construct, calibrate, and validate the model. Clinical trial 
      simulations were performed for different anti-amyloid antibodies, including a 
      5-year simulation of subcutaneous gantenerumab treatment. RESULTS: The simulated 
      time-course of biomarkers and CDR-SB was consistent with natural history studies 
      and described the effects of several anti-amyloid antibodies observed in trials 
      with positive and negative (or non-significant) outcomes. The 5-year simulation 
      predicts that the beneficial effects of continued anti-amyloid treatment should 
      increase markedly over time. DISCUSSION: The Q-ATN model offers a novel approach 
      for linking amyloid PET to CDR-SB, and provides theoretical support for the 
      potential clinical benefit of anti-amyloid therapy. HIGHLIGHTS: A 
      semi-mechanistic model was developed to link amyloid/tau/neurodegeneration 
      biomarkers to clinical outcome (Q-ATN model). The Q-ATN model describes the 
      disease progression seen in natural history studies. Model simulations agree well 
      with mean data from the aducanumab EMERGE study. A 5-year simulation of 
      gantenerumab predicts greater benefit with longer treatment.

LID - 10.1056/NEJMoa2212948 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The accumulation of soluble and insoluble aggregated amyloid-beta 
      (Aβ) may initiate or potentiate pathologic processes in Alzheimer's disease. 
      Lecanemab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity to 
      Aβ soluble protofibrils, is being tested in persons with early Alzheimer's 
      disease. METHODS: We conducted an 18-month, multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 
      trial involving persons 50 to 90 years of age with early Alzheimer's disease 
      (mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease) with 
      evidence of amyloid on positron-emission tomography (PET) or by cerebrospinal 
      fluid testing. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
      intravenous lecanemab (10 mg per kilogram of body weight every 2 weeks) or 
      placebo. The primary end point was the change from baseline at 18 months in the 
      score on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB; range, 0 to 18, with 
      higher scores indicating greater impairment). Key secondary end points were the 
      change in amyloid burden on PET, the score on the 14-item cognitive subscale of 
      the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog14; range, 0 to 90; higher 
      scores indicate greater impairment), the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score 
      (ADCOMS; range, 0 to 1.97; higher scores indicate greater impairment), and the 
      score on the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living 
      Scale for Mild Cognitive Impairment (ADCS-MCI-ADL; range, 0 to 53; lower scores 
      indicate greater impairment). RESULTS: A total of 1795 participants were 
      enrolled, with 898 assigned to receive lecanemab and 897 to receive placebo. The 
      mean CDR-SB score at baseline was approximately 3.2 in both groups. The adjusted 
      least-squares mean change from baseline at 18 months was 1.21 with lecanemab and 
      1.66 with placebo (difference, -0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.67 to 
      -0.23; P<0.001). In a substudy involving 698 participants, there were greater 
      reductions in brain amyloid burden with lecanemab than with placebo (difference, 
      -59.1 centiloids; 95% CI, -62.6 to -55.6). Other mean differences between the two 
      groups in the change from baseline favoring lecanemab were as follows: for the 
      ADAS-cog14 score, -1.44 (95% CI, -2.27 to -0.61; P<0.001); for the ADCOMS, -0.050 
      (95% CI, -0.074 to -0.027; P<0.001); and for the ADCS-MCI-ADL score, 2.0 (95% CI, 
      1.2 to 2.8; P<0.001). Lecanemab resulted in infusion-related reactions in 26.4% 
      of the participants and amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema or 
      effusions in 12.6%. CONCLUSIONS: Lecanemab reduced markers of amyloid in early 
      Alzheimer's disease and resulted in moderately less decline on measures of 
      cognition and function than placebo at 18 months but was associated with adverse 
      events. Longer trials are warranted to determine the efficacy and safety of 
      lecanemab in early Alzheimer's disease. (Funded by Eisai and Biogen; Clarity AD

TI  - Gantenerumab: an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody with potential 
      disease-modifying effects in early Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This review describes the research and development process of 
      gantenerumab, a fully human anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody in development to 
      treat early symptomatic and asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Anti-amyloid 
      monoclonal antibodies can substantially reverse amyloid plaque pathology and may 
      modify the course of the disease by slowing or stopping its clinical progression. 
      Several molecules targeting amyloid have failed in clinical development due to 
      drug-related factors (e.g., treatment-limiting adverse events, low potency, poor 
      brain penetration), study design/methodological issues (e.g., disease stage, lack 
      of AD pathology confirmation), and other factors. The US Food and Drug 
      Administration's approval of aducanumab, an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody as 
      the first potential disease-modifying therapy for AD, signaled the value of more 
      than 20 years of drug development, adding to the available therapies the first 
      nominal success since cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine were approved. 
      BODY: Here, we review over 2 decades of gantenerumab development in the context 
      of scientific discoveries in the broader AD field. Key learnings from the field 
      were incorporated into the gantenerumab phase 3 program, including confirmed 
      amyloid positivity as an entry criterion, an enriched clinical trial population 
      to ensure measurable clinical decline, data-driven exposure-response models to 
      inform a safe and efficacious dosing regimen, and the use of several blood-based 
      biomarkers. Subcutaneous formulation for more pragmatic implementation was 
      prioritized as a key feature from the beginning of the gantenerumab development 
      program. CONCLUSION: The results from the gantenerumab phase 3 programs are 
      expected by the end of 2022 and will add critical information to the collective 
      knowledge on the search for effective AD treatments.

TI  - Subcortical signal alteration of corticospinal tracts. A radiologic manifestation 
      of ARIA: A case report.
PG  - 275-279
LID - 10.1016/j.radcr.2022.10.023 [doi]
AB  - Patients with Alzheimer's disease who have been given monoclonal antibodies 
      targeting amyloid-β (Aβ) (eg, gantenerumab, donanemab, lecanemab, and aducanumab) 
      for scientific purposes may have a spectrum of imaging findings known as 
      amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), shown on brain magnetic resonance 
      imaging (MRI) scans. These neuroimaging abnormalities are caused by 
      antibody-mediated destruction of accumulated Aβ aggregates in cerebral blood 
      vessels and brain parenchyma. ARIA may demonstrate as brain edema or sulcal 
      effusion (ARIA-E) or as hemosiderin deposits caused by brain parenchymal or pial 
      hemorrhage (ARIA-H). The current study explores 2 cases with interval development 
      of FLAIR hyper signal intensity along the bilateral corticospinal tracts in the 
      motor cortex/precentral gyri after treatment by aducanumab. We believe this 
      manifestation is a subtype of ARIA-A that has not been explored earlier. Our 
      first case was a 72-year-old woman with a history of HTN and kidney transplant 
      (polycystic kidney) who presented with mild cognitive impairment with clinical 
      findings consistent with early Alzheimer's disease. After receiving 3 doses of 
      aducunumab and experiencing cognition improvement, she underwent a brain MRI 
      because of dizziness and vertigo. The brain MRI demonstrated new FLAIR hyper 
      signal intensity in subcortical regions of precentral gyri (motor cortex) 
      symmetrically as well as trace subarachnoid hemorrhage at the vertex compatible 
      with ARIA-E and ARIA-H. Our second case was an 85-year-old woman with a history 
      of small lymphocytic leukemia which was treated 20 years earlier. After 
      orthopedic surgery 2 years ago, she developed dementia with anterograde amnesia. 
      Since then, Aricept and Namenda have been started, but there have been no 
      improvements in her subjective condition. The initial Amyloid PET/MR imaging 
      showed diffuse cerebral Amyloid deposition. After tolerating 6 doses of 
      aducanumab a safety MRI revealed new bilateral symmetric FLAIR hyper signal 
      intensity in the subcortical motor cortex. Results of our study suggest that the 
      subcortical corticospinal tract is another hotspot for ARIA findings. Hence, 
      these regions might be an unknown site for both the action and adverse effects of 
      aducanumab on amyloid plaques with secondary inflammation. In addition, 
      radiologists must take this phenomenon into the account, and be cognizant that 
      the FLAIR hyper signal intensities should not be misinterpreted as motor neuron 
      disease (eg, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).

      putative scenarios and timeline in case of approval, recommendations for use, 
      implementation, and ethical considerations in France.

AB  - In 2021, aducanumab, an immunotherapy targeting amyloid-β, was approved for 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the US Food and Drug Administration thanks to 
      positive results on a putative biological surrogate marker. This approval has 
      raised an unprecedented controversy. It was followed by a refusal of the European 
      Medicine Agency, which does not allow the marketing of drugs solely on biological 
      arguments and raised safety issues, and important US coverage limitations by the 
      Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies 
      showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase II trials, and 
      five drugs are being studied in phase III trials. Lecanemab is currently under 
      examination for an 'Accelerated Approval' in the US, with an expected decision in 
      January 2023. The common feature and novelty of these anti-amyloid 
      immunotherapies, compared to those tested in previous trials of the 2010s, is 
      their ability to induce a high clearance of amyloid load, as measured with 
      positron emission tomography, in the brain of early-stage biomarker-proven AD 
      patients. In the first part of this review, we underlined through a meta-analysis 
      that the pooled data from high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies trials 
      demonstrated a significant but slight clinical effect after 18 months. Still, 
      safety remains an issue with serious and symptomatic amyloid-related imaging 
      abnormalities, which are seldom (∼1 per 200 treated patients) but occur beyond 
      chance. In the second part of this review, we hypothesized that there is a high 
      probability that some phase III trials of high-clearance anti-amyloid 
      immunotherapies in early AD will finally be unarguably positive on clinical 
      outcomes in the next five years with acceptable safety data. This may, in turn, 
      lead to approval by the European Medicine Agency if the risk-benefit profile is 
      deemed favorable. Such approval would be a game-changer in managing AD patients 
      and for the organization of memory clinics in France. We review the possible 
      timeline and scenarios for putative approval in France and make propositions 
      regarding putative use in clinical practice, putative implementation in a 
      real-life setting, and ethical considerations.

TI  - Lecanemab, Aducanumab, and Gantenerumab - Binding Profiles to Different Forms of 
      Amyloid-Beta Might Explain Efficacy and Side Effects in Clinical Trials for 
      Alzheimer's Disease.

AB  - Immunotherapy against amyloid-beta (Aβ) is a promising option for the treatment 
      of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ exists as various species, including monomers, 
      oligomers, protofibrils, and insoluble fibrils in plaques. Oligomers and 
      protofibrils have been shown to be toxic, and removal of these aggregates might 
      represent an effective treatment for AD. We have characterized the binding 
      properties of lecanemab, aducanumab, and gantenerumab to different Aβ species 
      with inhibition ELISA, immunodepletion, and surface plasmon resonance. All three 
      antibodies bound monomers with low affinity. However, lecanemab and aducanumab 
      had very weak binding to monomers, and gantenerumab somewhat stronger binding. 
      Lecanemab was distinctive as it had tenfold stronger binding to protofibrils 
      compared to fibrils. Aducanumab and gantenerumab preferred binding to fibrils 
      over protofibrils. Our results show different binding profiles of lecanemab, 
      aducanumab, and gantenerumab that may explain clinical results observed for these 
      antibodies regarding both efficacy and side effects.

AB  - In 2021, aducanumab, an immunotherapy targeting amyloid-β, was approved for 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) by the US Food and Drug Administration thanks to 
      positive results on a putative biological surrogate marker. This approval has 
      raised an unprecedented controversy. It was followed by a refusal of the European 
      Medicine Agency, which does not allow the marketing of drugs solely on biological 
      arguments and raised safety issues, and important US coverage limitations by the 
      Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Two other anti-amyloid immunotherapies 
      showed significant results regarding a clinical outcome in phase 2 trials, and 
      five drugs are being studied in phase 3 trials. Compared to those tested in 
      previous trials of the 2010s, the common feature and novelty of these 
      anti-amyloid immunotherapies is their ability to induce a high clearance of 
      amyloid load, as measured with positron emission tomography, in the brain of 
      early-stage biomarker-proven AD patients. Here, we review the available evidence 
      regarding efficacy and safety data and medico-economical aspects for 
      high-clearance anti-amyloid immunotherapies. We also perform frequentist and 
      Bayesian meta-analyses of the clinical efficacy and safety of the highest dose 
      groups from the two aducanumab phase 3 trials and the donanemab and lecanemab 
      phase 2 trials. When pooled together, the data from high-clearance anti-amyloid 
      immunotherapies trials confirm a statistically significant clinical effect of 
      these drugs on cognitive decline after 18 months (difference in cognitive decline 
      measured with CDR-SB after 18 months between the high dose immunotherapy groups 
      vs. placebo = -0.24 points; P=0.04, frequentist random-effect model), with 
      results on ADAS-Cog being the most statistically robust. However, this effect 
      remains below the previously established minimal clinically relevant values. In 
      parallel, the drugs significantly increased the occurrence of amyloid-related 
      imaging abnormalities-edema (ARIA-E: risk ratio=13.39; P<0.0001), ARIA-hemorrhage 
      (risk ratio=2.78; P=0.0002), and symptomatic and serious ARIA (7/1321=0.53% in 
      the high dose groups versus 0/1446 in the placebo groups; risk ratio=6.44; 
      P=0.04). The risk/benefit ratio of high-clearance immunotherapies in early AD is 
      so far questionable after 18 months. Identifying subgroups of better responders, 
      the perspective of combination therapies, and a longer follow-up may help improve 
      their clinical relevance. Finally, the preliminary evidence from 
      medico-economical analyses seems to indicate that the current cost of aducanumab 
      in the US is not in reasonable alignment with its clinical benefits.

AB  - Lecanemab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that selectively 
      binds to soluble Aβ aggregate species, while demonstrating low affinity for Aβ 
      monomer. This article describes the population pharmacokinetic (PK) and 
      PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses for amyloid plaques, as measured using positron 
      emission tomography (PET), and biomarkers of amyloid pathology as evidenced by 
      Aβ42/40 ratio and plasma p-tau181 following i.v. administration of lecanemab in 
      subjects with early Alzheimer's disease. Lecanemab PKs were well-characterized 
      with a two-compartment model with first-order elimination. Final PK model 
      contained covariate effects of anti-drug antibody positive status, sex, body 
      weight, and albumin on clearance. The time course of amyloid PET standard uptake 
      ratio (SUVr), plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, and p-tau181 were described using indirect 
      response models with lecanemab exposure as a maximum effect function stimulating 
      the reduction of SUVr, and as a linear function increasing Aβ42/40 ratio and 
      decreasing p-tau181 formation rates. PK/PD simulations show that 10 mg/kg 
      biweekly dosing results in larger and faster decrease in SUVr and p-tau181 and 
      increase in Aβ42/40 ratio as compared to 10 mg/kg monthly dose. Furthermore, the 
      PK/PD simulations showed that after treatment discontinuation the brain amyloid 
      re-accumulation to baseline levels is slow with a recovery half-life of ~4 years, 
      whereas plasma Aβ42/40 ratio and p-tau181 return to baseline levels faster than 
      amyloid. Given the relationship between changes in amyloid PET SUVr and soluble 
      biomarkers, the developed PK/PD models can be used to inform lecanemab dose 
      regimens in future clinical studies.

TI  - The AHEAD 3-45 Study: Design of a prevention trial for Alzheimer's disease.
PG  - 1227-1233
LID - 10.1002/alz.12748 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum begins with a long 
      asymptomatic or preclinical stage, during which amyloid beta (Aβ) is accumulating 
      for more than a decade prior to widespread cortical tauopathy, neurodegeneration, 
      and manifestation of clinical symptoms. The AHEAD 3-45 Study (BAN2401-G000-303) 
      is testing whether intervention with lecanemab (BAN2401), a humanized 
      immunoglobulin 1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that preferentially targets soluble 
      aggregated Aβ, initiated during this asymptomatic stage can slow biomarker 
      changes and/or cognitive decline. The AHEAD 3-45 Study is conducted as a 
      Public-Private Partnership of the Alzheimer's Clinical Trial Consortium (ACTC), 
      funded by the National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health (NIH), 
      and Eisai Inc. METHODS: The AHEAD 3-45 Study was launched on July 14, 2020, and 
      consists of two sister trials (A3 and A45) in cognitively unimpaired (CU) 
      individuals ages 55 to 80 with specific dosing regimens tailored to baseline 
      brain amyloid levels on screening positron emission tomography (PET) scans: 
      intermediate amyloid (≈20 to 40 Centiloids) for A3 and elevated amyloid (>40 
      Centiloids) for A45. Both trials are being conducted under a single protocol, 
      with a shared screening process and common schedule of assessments. A3 is a Phase 
      2 trial with PET-imaging end points, whereas A45 is a Phase 3 trial with a 
      cognitive composite primary end point. The treatment period is 4 years. The study 
      utilizes innovative approaches to enriching the sample with individuals who have 
      elevated brain amyloid. These include recruiting from the Trial-Ready Cohort for 
      Preclinical and Prodromal Alzheimer's disease (TRC-PAD), the Australian Dementia 
      Network (ADNeT) Registry, and the Japanese Trial Ready Cohort (J-TRC), as well as 
      incorporation of plasma screening with the C2N mass spectrometry platform to 
      quantitate the Aβ 42/40 ratio (Aβ 42/40), which has been shown previously to 
      reliably identify cognitively normal participants not likely to have elevated 
      brain amyloid levels. A blood sample collected at a brief first visit is utilized 
      to "screen out" individuals who are less likely to have elevated brain amyloid, 
      and to determine the participant's eligibility to proceed to PET imaging. 
      Eligibility to randomize into the A3 Trial or A45 Trial is based on the screening 
      PET imaging results. RESULT: The focus of this article is on the innovative 
      design of the study. DISCUSSION: The AHEAD 3-45 Study will test whether with 
      lecanemab (BAN2401) can slow the accumulation of tau and prevent the cognitive 
      decline associated with AD during its preclinical stage. It is specifically 
      targeting both the preclinical and the early preclinical (intermediate amyloid) 
      stages of AD and is the first secondary prevention trial to employ plasma-based 
      biomarkers to accelerate the screening process and potentially substantially 
      reduce the number of screening PET scans.

TI  - Drug discovery in spinal cord injury-induced osteoporosis: a text mining-based 
      study.
PG  - 733

LID - 733
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spinal cord injury (SCI) and osteoporosis (OP) are common diseases in 
      spine surgery, and OP could be the complication of SCI. However, SCI-induced OP 
      is a complex pathologic process and drug discovery is limited, which restricts 
      the study in the mechanism and treatment of the disease. This study aims to 
      identify the genes and molecular pathways related to SCI-induced OP through 
      computational tools and public datasets, and to explore drug targeting therapy, 
      ultimately preventing the occurrence of OP after SCI. METHODS: In this study, 
      common genes related to SCI and OP were obtained by text mining, then which 
      conducted the functional analysis. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks 
      were constructed by STRING online and Cytoscape software. Finally, core genes and 
      potential drugs were performed after undergoing drug-gene interaction analysis 
      which also completed functional analysis. RESULTS: A total of 371 genes common to 
      'SCI' and 'OP' were identified by text mining. After functional analysis, 207 
      significant genes were screened out. Subsequently, PPI analysis yielded 23 genes 
      targetable by 13 drugs which were the candidate to treat SCI-induced OP. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, siltuximab, olokizumab, clazakizumab and BAN2401 
      were first discovered to become the potential drugs for the treatment of 
      SCI-induced OP. Drug discovery using text mining and pathway analysis is a 
      significant way to investigate the pathomechanism of the disease while exploring 
      existing drugs to treat the disease.

TI  - [Therapeutic news in Alzheimer’s disease: soon a disease-modifying therapy?].
PG  - 256-260
LID - 10.1684/pnv.2022.1042 [doi]
AB  - Research on disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s disease has resulted in 
      a series of failures over the past 20 years. However, in the last 4 years, five 
      molecules have shown significant effects in phase II or III trials on clinical 
      endpoints (i.e., slowing of cognitive decline). Among these five molecules, three 
      are anti-amyloid immunotherapies: aducanumab, donanemab, and lecanemab 
      responsible for a significant clearance of cerebral amyloid deposits. These 
      results are still awaiting confirmation in order to put an end to the controversy 
      surrounding the Food and Drug Administration’s decision to give conditional 
      approval to aducanumab, which is considered premature by many specialists. 
      Confirmation is also necessary to assess the benefit (magnitude of the slowing of 
      decline) and risk (edema and cerebral hemorrhage induced by these treatments) 
      balance of these molecules, which appears to be so far questionable after 18 
      months. Masitinib, a treatment whose probable mechanism of action is 
      neuroinflammation, has also shown positive effects that need to be confirmed. 
      Treatments targeting the tau protein are less advanced but weak signals are 
      emerging from immunotherapies in the moderate stages of the disease 
      (semorinemab). There is renewed hope for patients since it may not be 
      unreasonable that these disease-modifying therapies will be part of the French 
      therapeutic arsenal within the next five years.

TI  - The Future of AD Clinical Trials with the Advent of Anti-Amyloid Therapies: An 
      CTAD Task Force Report.
PG  - 393-399
LID - 10.14283/jpad.2022.48 [doi]
AB  - Aducanumab (ADUHELMTM) was approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      in the US. This approval was supported by an effect on the cerebral amyloid 
      plaque load and evidence of cognitive efficacy to be confirmed in post-marketing 
      trials. Other anti-amyloid antibodies are under investigation in phase III 
      (donanemab, lecanemab, gantenerumab) and have shown preliminary evidence of a 
      cognitive benefit in phase II trials. Although these agents target a small 
      segment of patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia, 
      their advent will change the design of future clinical trials both for 
      anti-amyloid and non-amyloid drugs. These changes will promote the selection of 
      patients in clinical trials by amyloid and tau biomarkers that identify patients 
      with appropriate biology and may follow the treatment response to approved 
      amyloid antibodies. The use of these agents creates the opportunity to test 
      combined drug therapies and to conduct comparative assessments with innovative 
      therapies and newly approved drugs available in clinical practice. Blood-based AD 
      biomarkers should be implemented in research and could facilitate the recruitment 
      into clinical trials. Anti-amyloid antibodies will have positive (e.g., more 
      early diagnosis) and negative impacts (some subjects will be reluctant to 
      participate in trials and risk assignment to placebo) on AD trials in the 
      immediate future. We present the results of the CTAD Task Force on this topic, in 
      Boston, November 6, 2021.

TI  - The Potential Economic Value of Lecanemab in Patients with Early Alzheimer's 
      Disease Using Simulation Modeling.
PG  - 1285-1307
LID - 10.1007/s40120-022-00373-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative 
      disease that affects memory, thinking, and behavior and places a substantial 
      economic burden on caregivers and healthcare systems. This early-phase study 
      aimed to model lecanemab, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid 
      protofibrils, for patients with early AD, and estimate the potential value-based 
      price (VBP) of lecanemab + standard of care (SoC) compared to SoC alone given an 
      expected product profile of lecanemab informed by data from a phase II trial from 
      payer and societal perspectives using a broad range of willingness-to-pay (WTP) 
      thresholds in the USA. METHODS: A disease simulation model was used to capture 
      how key AD pathology components relate to the clinical and economic presentation 
      of AD. The effects of disease modification and early intervention on disease 
      progression were simulated on the basis of BAN2401-G000-201 trial data as well as 
      published literature. Model outcomes included patient and caregiver 
      quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), total life years, and total care costs 
      including direct medical and non-medical costs for healthcare resource use and 
      indirect costs for caregiving over a lifetime horizon. RESULTS: Lecanemab + SoC 
      was predicted to result in a gain of 0.61 QALYs (societal, 0.64) and a $8707 
      decrease in total non-treatment costs (societal, $11,214) vs. SoC alone for 
      patients with early AD. For a WTP threshold range of $50,000 to $200,000 per QALY 
      gained, the potential annual VBP of lecanemab was estimated at $9249 (societal, 
      $10,400) to $35,605 (societal, $38,053), respectively. Other patient subsets, 
      treatment stopping rules, and dosing regimens were used to assess the sensitivity 
      of the VBP estimates. CONCLUSION: The early model predicted that lecanemab would 
      potentially improve long-term health outcomes and reduce formal and informal care 
      costs, resulting in a range of VBPs that reflect the value of lecanemab to 
      society.

AB  - Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) are adverse events reported in 
      Alzheimer's disease trials of anti-amyloid beta (Aβ) therapies. This review 
      summarizes the existing literature on ARIA, including bapineuzumab, gantenerumab, 
      donanemab, lecanemab, and aducanumab studies, with regard to potential risk 
      factors, detection, and management. The pathophysiology of ARIA is unclear, but 
      it may be related to binding of antibodies to accumulated Aβ in both the cerebral 
      parenchyma and vasculature, resulting in loss of vessel wall integrity and 
      increased leakage into surrounding tissues. Radiographically, ARIA-E is 
      identified as vasogenic edema in the brain parenchyma or sulcal effusions in the 
      leptomeninges/sulci, while ARIA-H is hemosiderin deposits presenting as 
      microhemorrhages or superficial siderosis. ARIA tends to be transient and 
      asymptomatic in most cases, typically occurring early in the course of treatment, 
      with the risk decreasing later in treatment. Limited data are available on 
      continued dosing following radiographic findings of ARIA; hence, in the event of 
      ARIA, treatment should be continued with caution and regular monitoring. Clinical 
      trials have implemented management approaches such as temporary suspension of 
      treatment until symptoms or radiographic signs of ARIA have resolved or permanent 
      discontinuation of treatment. ARIA largely resolves without concomitant 
      treatment, and there are no systematic data on potential treatments for ARIA. 
      Given the availability of an anti-Aβ therapy, ARIA monitoring will now be 
      implemented in routine clinical practice. The simple magnetic resonance imaging 
      sequences used in clinical trials are likely sufficient for effective detection 
      of cases. Increased awareness and education of ARIA among clinicians and 
      radiologists is vital.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a global health crisis. 
      Treatments are needed to prevent, delay the onset, slow the progression, improve 
      cognition, and reduce behavioral disturbances of AD. We review the current 
      clinical trials and drugs in development for the treatment of AD. METHODS: We 
      searched the governmental website clinicaltrials.gov where are all clinical 
      trials conducted in the United States must be registered. We used artificial 
      intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches to ensure comprehensive 
      detection and characterization of trials and drugs in development. We use the 
      Common Alzheimer's Disease Research Ontology (CADRO) to classify drug targets and 
      mechanisms of action of drugs in the pipeline. RESULTS: As of January 25, 2022 
      (index date for this study) there were 143 agents in 172 clinical trials for AD. 
      The pipeline included 31 agents in 47 trials in Phase 3, 82 agents in 94 trials 
      in Phase 2, and 30 agents in 31 trials in Phase 1. Disease-modifying therapies 
      represent 83.2% of the total number of agents in trials; symptomatic cognitive 
      enhancing treatments represent 9.8% of agents in trials; and drugs for the 
      treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms comprise 6.9%. There is a diverse array of 
      drug targets represented by agents in trials including nearly all CADRO 
      categories. Thirty-seven percent of the candidate agents in the pipeline are 
      repurposed drugs approved for other indications. A total of 50,575 participants 
      are needed to fulfill recruitment requirements for all currently active clinical 
      trials. DISCUSSION: The AD drug development pipeline has agents representing a 
      substantial array of treatment mechanisms and targets. Advances in drug design, 
      outcome measures, use of biomarkers, and trial conduct promise to accelerate the 
      delivery of new and better treatments for patients with AD. HIGHLIGHTS: There are 
      143 drugs in the current Alzheimer's disease (AD) drug development 
      pipeline.Disease-modifying therapies represent 83.2% of the candidate 
      treatments.Current trials require 50,575 participants who will donate 3,878,843 
      participant-weeks to clinical trials.The biopharmaceutical industry sponsors 50% 
      of all clinical trials including 68% of Phase 3 trials.Sixty-three percent of 
      Phase 3 trials and 46% of Phase 2 trials include non-North American clinical 
      trial site locations indicating the global ecosystem required for AD drug 
      development.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of age-related dementia in 
      the world, and its main pathological features consist of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque 
      deposits and neurofibrillary tangles formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein. 
      So far, only a few AD treatments approved have been applied in the clinic, but 
      the effects of these drugs are limited only for partial symptomatic relief to 
      patients with AD and are unable to alter AD progression. Later, all efforts for 
      AD treatments with targeting the pathogenic factors were unsuccessful over the 
      past decades, which suggested that the pathogenesis of AD is complex. Recently, 
      disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) that can change the underlying pathophysiology 
      of AD, with anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (mabs) (e.g., aducanumab, bapineuzumab, 
      gantenerumab, solanezumab, and lecanemab) have been developed successively and 
      conducted in clinical trials based on the theory that a systemic failure of 
      cell-mediated Aβ clearance contributes to AD occurrence and progression. In the 
      review, we summarized recent studies on the therapeutic effects and clinical 
      trial results of these mabs in patients with AD. Specifically, we focused on the 
      discussion of the impact of aducanumab and lecanemab on AD pathology and clinical 
      profiles. The review provides a possible evidence for applying immunotherapy with 
      anti-Aβ mabs in AD and analyzes lessons learned from these clinical trials in 
      order to further study the therapeutic and adverse effects of these anti-Aβ mabs 
      on AD.

AB  - Research on disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease has resulted in 
      a series of failures over the past 20 years. However, in the last three years, 
      four molecules have shown significant effects on clinical endpoints in phase II 
      or III clinical trials (i.e., slowing of cognitive decline). Among these four 
      molecules, three are anti-amyloid immunotherapies: aducanumab, donanemab, and 
      lecanemab, responsible for a significant clearance of cerebral beta-amyloid 
      deposits. These provisional data are still awaiting confirmation to put an end to 
      the controversy surrounding the 2021 Food and Drug Administration's decision to 
      give conditional approval to aducanumab, which is considered premature by many 
      specialists. Confirmation is also necessary to assess the benefit (magnitude of 
      the slowing of cognitive decline) and risk (edema and cerebral hemorrhage induced 
      by these treatments) balance of these molecules. Masitinib, a treatment whose 
      probable mechanism of action is neuroinflammation, has also shown positive 
      effects that need to be confirmed. Therapies targeting the tau protein are less 
      advanced and have yet to be proven. Patients have renewed hope since it may not 
      be unreasonable that these disease-modifying therapies will be part of the French 
      therapeutic arsenal within the next five years.

TI  - Long-Term Health Outcomes of Lecanemab in Patients with Early Alzheimer's Disease 
      Using Simulation Modeling.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative 
      disease and is the most common cause of dementia. Lecanemab is a humanized 
      monoclonal antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils for the treatment of early AD. 
      In the phase II BAN2401-G000-201 trial (NCT01767311), lecanemab reduced amyloid 
      accumulated in the brain and slowed progression on key global and cognitive 
      scales evaluating efficacy after 18 months of treatment. METHODS: A disease 
      simulation model was used to predict the long-term clinical outcomes of lecanemab 
      for patients with early AD [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD and 
      mild AD dementia] on the basis of BAN2401-G000-201 trial data and published 
      literature. The model captures the pathophysiology and management of AD, with a 
      focus on simulating the effects of disease modification and early intervention on 
      disease progression. The model compares lecanemab in addition to standard of care 
      (SoC) versus SoC alone. RESULTS: Lecanemab treatment was estimated to slow the 
      rate of disease progression, resulting in an extended duration of MCI due to AD 
      and mild AD dementia and shortened duration in moderate and severe AD dementia. 
      The mean time to mild, moderate, and severe AD dementia was longer for patients 
      in the lecanemab + SoC group than for patients in the SoC group by 2.51, 3.13, 
      and 2.34 years, respectively. On base-case analysis, lecanemab was associated 
      with 0.73 incremental life years (LY) and 0.75 incremental quality-adjusted LYs 
      (QALY), and the caregiver QALYs lost was reduced by 0.03 years. The model also 
      predicted a lower lifetime probability of admission to institutional care in 
      lecanemab + SoC versus SoC group (25% versus 31%). CONCLUSION: The model results 
      demonstrate the potential clinical value of lecanemab for patients with early AD 
      and how it can slow the rate of disease progression and reduce the lifetime 
      probability for institutionalized care.

AB  - Second-generation anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies are emerging as a viable 
      therapeutic option for individuals with prodromal and mild dementia due to 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Passive immunotherapy with aducanumab (Aduhelm), 
      lecanemab, donanemab, and gantenerumab all lower CNS amyloid (Aβ) burden but come 
      with a significant risk of amyloid-related imaging abnormality (ARIA)-the most 
      common side effect of this class of drugs. While usually asymptomatic and 
      detected only on brain MRI, ARIA may lead to new signs and symptoms including 
      headache, worsening confusion, dizziness, visual disturbances, nausea, and 
      seizures. In addition, one fatality related to ARIA-E (edema) with aducanumab and 
      one fatality due to ARIA-H (hemorrhage) with donanemab are reported to date. 
      ARIA-E may be associated with excessive neuroinflammation and saturation of 
      perivascular clearance pathways, while ARIA-H may be related to vascular amyloid 
      clearance with weakening and rupture of small blood vessels. The risk of ARIA-E 
      is higher at treatment initiation, in ApoE4 carriers, with higher dosage, and 
      with >4 of microhemorrhages on a baseline MRI. The risk of ARIA-H increases with 
      age and cerebrovascular disease. Dose titration mitigates the risk of ARIA, and 
      contraindications include individuals with >4 microhemorrhages and those 
      prescribed anti-platelet or anti-coagulant drugs. A brain MRI is required before 
      aducanumab is initiated, before each scheduled dose escalation, and with any new 
      neurologic sign or symptom. Management of ARIA ranges from continued antibody 
      treatment with monthly MRI monitoring for asymptomatic individuals to temporary 
      or permanent suspension for symptomatic individuals or those with moderate to 
      severe ARIA on MRI. Controlled studies regarding prevention and treatment of ARIA 
      are lacking, but anecdotal evidence suggests that a pulse of intravenous 
      corticosteroids may be of benefit, as well as a course of anticonvulsant for 
      seizures.

TI  - Application of Meta-analysis to Evaluate Relationships Among ARIA-E Rate, Amyloid 
      Reduction Rate, and Clinical Cognitive Response in Amyloid Therapeutic Clinical 
      Trials for Early Alzheimer's Disease.
PG  - 501-516
LID - 10.1007/s43441-022-00390-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Removal of the extracellular Aβ plaques in the brain is one of the 
      mechanisms to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Separate clinical trials for 
      several therapeutic compounds that target amyloid plaque reduction have shown 
      noteworthy correlations among plaque removal, the Amyloid-Related Imaging 
      Abnormalities (ARIA) rate, and clinical efficacy of the treatment. The 
      relationships among therapeutic dose levels, the rate of amyloid removal, and the 
      clinical efficacy deserve further investigation across therapeutic agents, 
      particularly for clinical trials to provide insights for strategies to develop 
      amyloid therapies in Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: Published data summaries from 
      clinical trials with amyloid therapies of aducanumab, donanemab, lecanemab, and 
      gantenerumab are evaluated with meta-analyses. Linear mixed models for repeated 
      measurements for visits and random study effects are applied to analyze amyloid 
      centiloid value reduction from baseline and clinical cognition change from 
      baseline for treatment groups according to doses and compounds for the clinical 
      trials. Logistic regression analysis is applied to evaluate the relationship 
      between the amyloid removal rate and the ARIA-Edema (ARIA-E) rate across 
      different dose groups and clinical trials. RESULTS: The extent of amyloid removal 
      varies among therapeutic agents and their dose levels. Across treatment groups 
      and clinical trials, amyloid centiloid value reductions at Weeks 26 and 52 are 
      strongly correlated with both ARIA-E rate over 78 weeks and the clinical efficacy 
      response in the Clinical Dementia-Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) score change 
      from baseline at Week 78; and the Spearman rank correlations for amyloid 
      reduction at Week 52 are stronger as - 0.79 with the ARIA-E rate over 78 weeks 
      and 0.73 with the Week 78 CDR-SB score change from baseline. CONCLUSION: Aβ 
      plaques removal in the brain due to amyloid therapy is strongly correlated with a 
      better clinical response in patients with early Alzheimer's disease and a higher 
      ARIA-E rate for the treatment groups and clinical trials in this meta-analysis. 
      These relationships suggest that the balance between the clinical efficacy 
      response and safety in ARIA-E rate is relevant for the choice of doses for 
      amyloid therapies in confirmatory clinical trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. The 
      number of people affected will increase dramatically in the coming decades due to 
      the demographic change. Causal pharmacological approaches have not been available 
      to date. The monoclonal anti-amyloid beta antibody aducanumab was recently 
      approved for the treatment of AD in the USA but was rejected in Europe in 
      December 2021 by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). OBJECTIVE: This review 
      presents the background and rationale for amyloid beta-directed treatment 
      approaches in AD. The focus is on passive immunization with monoclonal 
      anti-amyloid beta antibodies. DATA SITUATION: There are four monoclonal 
      anti-amyloid beta antibodies in an advanced stage of clinical development. 
      Evidence of a clear and significant reduction of the cerebral amyloid load was 
      found for all of them. In the case of aducanumab this has already led to approval 
      by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In the USA donanemab, 
      gantenerumab and lecanemab have received the status of a so-called breakthrough 
      therapy and are expected to go through an accelerated approval process by the FDA 
      in the next 1-2 years. CONCLUSION: Anti-amyloid antibodies represent the first 
      cause-based, disease-modifying therapy for AD approved in the USA. Compared to 
      the near-complete removal of cerebral amyloid plaques, the magnitude of the 
      clinical effect is smaller and the benefit for patients is currently subject to 
      controversial discussions. Nonetheless, the new treatment option represents an 
      important step in the development of effective treatment. Future strategies for 
      the treatment of AD will likely aim at a multimodal concept with different 
      molecular targets. A prerequisite for all effective disease-modifying therapies 
      will be an early biomarker-based diagnosis prior to the onset of a dementia-type 
      syndrome.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterised by 
      cognitive impairment, behavioural alteration, and functional decline. Over 130 
      AD-associated susceptibility loci have been identified by genome-wide association 
      studies (GWAS), while whole genome sequencing (WGS) and whole exome sequencing 
      (WES) studies have identified AD-associated rare variants. These variants are 
      enriched in APOE, TREM2, CR1, CD33, CLU, BIN1, CD2AP, PILRA, SCIMP, PICALM, 
      SORL1, SPI1, RIN3, and more genes. Given that aging is the single largest risk 
      factor for late-onset AD (LOAD), the accumulation of somatic mutations in the 
      brain and blood of AD patients have also been explored. Collectively, these 
      genetic findings implicate the role of innate and adaptive immunity in LOAD 
      pathogenesis and suggest that a systemic failure of cell-mediated amyloid-β (Aβ) 
      clearance contributes to AD onset and progression. AD-associated variants are 
      particularly enriched in myeloid-specific regulatory regions, implying that AD 
      risk variants are likely to perturbate the expression of myeloid-specific 
      AD-associated genes to interfere Aβ clearance. Defective phagocytosis, 
      endocytosis, and autophagy may drive Aβ accumulation, which may be related to 
      naturally-occurring antibodies to Aβ (Nabs-Aβ) produced by adaptive responses. 
      Passive immunisation is providing efficiency in clearing Aβ and slowing cognitive 
      decline, such as aducanumab, donanemab, and lecanemab (ban2401). Causation of AD 
      by impairment of the innate immunity and treatment using the tools of adaptive 
      immunity is emerging as a new paradigm for AD, but immunotherapy that boosts the 
      innate immune functions of myeloid cells is highly expected to modulate disease 
      progression at asymptomatic stage.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapy is a promising therapeutic strategy in 
      the fight against Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of monoclonal antibodies 
      have entered clinical trials for AD. Some of them have failed due to the lack of 
      efficacy or side-effects, two antibodies are currently in phase 3, and one has 
      been approved by FDA. The soluble intermediate aggregated species of Aβ, termed 
      oligomers and protofibrils, are believed to be key pathogenic forms, responsible 
      for synaptic and neuronal degeneration in AD. Therefore, antibodies that can 
      strongly and selectively bind to these soluble intermediate aggregates are of 
      great diagnostic and therapeutic interest. METHODS: We designed and recombinantly 
      produced a hexavalent antibody based on mAb158, an Aβ protofibril-selective 
      antibody. The humanized version of mAb158, lecanemab (BAN2401), is currently in 
      phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of AD. The new designs involved 
      recombinantly fusing single-chain fragment variables to the N-terminal ends of 
      mAb158 antibody. Real-time interaction analysis with LigandTracer and surface 
      plasmon resonance were used to evaluate the kinetic binding properties of the 
      generated antibodies to Aβ protofibrils. Different ELISA setups were applied to 
      demonstrate the binding strength of the hexavalent antibody to Aβ aggregates of 
      different sizes. Finally, the ability of the antibodies to protect cells from 
      Aβ-induced effects was evaluated by MTT assay. RESULTS: Using real-time 
      interaction analysis with LigandTracer, the hexavalent design promoted a 40-times 
      enhanced binding with avidity to protofibrils, and most of the added binding 
      strength was attributed to the reduced rate of dissociation. Furthermore, ELISA 
      experiments demonstrated that the hexavalent design also had strong binding to 
      small oligomers, while retaining weak and intermediate binding to monomers and 
      insoluble fibrils. The hexavalent antibody also reduced cell death induced by a 
      mixture of soluble Aβ aggregates. CONCLUSION: We provide a new antibody design 
      with increased valency to promote binding avidity to an enhanced range of sizes 
      of Aβ aggregates. This approach should be general and work for any aggregated 
      protein or repetitive target.

TI  - Significance of Oligomeric and Fibrillar Species in Amyloidosis: Insights into 
      Pathophysiology and Treatment.
LID - 10.3390/molecules26165091 [doi]
LID - 5091
AB  - Amyloidosis is a term referring to a group of various protein-misfolding diseases 
      wherein normally soluble proteins form aggregates as insoluble amyloid fibrils. 
      How, or whether, amyloid fibrils contribute to tissue damage in amyloidosis has 
      been the topic of debate. In vitro studies have demonstrated the appearance of 
      small globular oligomeric species during the incubation of amyloid beta peptide 
      (Aβ). Nerve biopsy specimens from patients with systemic amyloidosis have 
      suggested that globular structures similar to Aβ oligomers were generated from 
      amorphous electron-dense materials and later developed into mature amyloid 
      fibrils. Schwann cells adjacent to amyloid fibrils become atrophic and 
      degenerative, suggesting that the direct tissue damage induced by amyloid fibrils 
      plays an important role in systemic amyloidosis. In contrast, there is increasing 
      evidence that oligomers, rather than amyloid fibrils, are responsible for cell 
      death in neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer's disease. 
      Disease-modifying therapies based on the pathophysiology of amyloidosis have now 
      become available. Aducanumab, a human monoclonal antibody against the aggregated 
      form of Aβ, was recently approved for Alzheimer's disease, and other monoclonal 
      antibodies, including gantenerumab, solanezumab, and lecanemab, could also be up 
      for approval. As many other agents for amyloidosis will be developed in the 
      future, studies to develop sensitive clinical scales for identifying improvement 
      and markers that can act as surrogates for clinical scales should be conducted.

TI  - Neurotoxic Soluble Amyloid Oligomers Drive Alzheimer's Pathogenesis and Represent 
      a Clinically Validated Target for Slowing Disease Progression.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22126355 [doi]
LID - 6355
AB  - A large body of clinical and nonclinical evidence supports the role of neurotoxic 
      soluble beta amyloid (amyloid, Aβ) oligomers as upstream pathogenic drivers of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent late-stage trials in AD that have evaluated 
      agents targeting distinct species of Aβ provide compelling evidence that 
      inhibition of Aβ oligomer toxicity represents an effective approach to slow or 
      stop disease progression: (1) only agents that target soluble Aβ oligomers show 
      clinical efficacy in AD patients; (2) clearance of amyloid plaque does not 
      correlate with clinical improvements; (3) agents that predominantly target 
      amyloid monomers or plaque failed to show clinical effects; and (4) in positive 
      trials, efficacy is greater in carriers of the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E 
      (APOE4), who are known to have higher brain concentrations of Aβ oligomers. These 
      trials also show that inhibiting Aβ neurotoxicity leads to a reduction in tau 
      pathology, suggesting a pathogenic sequence of events where amyloid toxicity 
      drives an increase in tau formation and deposition. The late-stage agents with 
      positive clinical or biomarker data include four antibodies that engage Aβ 
      oligomers (aducanumab, lecanemab, gantenerumab, and donanemab) and ALZ-801, an 
      oral agent that fully blocks the formation of Aβ oligomers at the clinical dose.

LID - 39
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, removing amyloid 
      beta (Aβ) should cure Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the past three decades, many 
      agents have been tested to try to lower Aβ production, prevent Aβ aggregation, 
      and dissolve Aβ deposits. However, the paucity in definitive preventative or 
      curative properties of these agents in clinical trials has resulted in more 
      avant-garde approaches to therapeutic investigations. Immunotherapy has become an 
      area of focus for research on disease-modifying therapies for neurodegenerative 
      diseases. In this review, we highlight the current clinical development landscape 
      of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies that target Aβ plaque formation and 
      removal in AD. RECENT FINDINGS: Multiple potential disease-modifying therapeutics 
      for AD are in active development. Targeting Aβ with mAbs has the potential to 
      treat various stages of AD: prodromal, prodromal to mild, mild, and mild to 
      moderate. Monoclonal antibodies discussed here include aducanumab, lecanemab, 
      solanezumab, crenezumab, donanemab, and gantenerumab. The final decision by the 
      FDA regarding the approval of aducanumab will offer valuable insight into the 
      trajectory of drug development for mAbs in AD and other neurodegenerative 
      diseases. Future directions for improving the treatment of AD will include more 
      inquiry into the efficacy of mAbs as disease-modifying agents that specifically 
      target Aβ peptides and/or multimers. In addition, a more robust trial design for 
      AD immunotherapy agents should improve outcomes such that objective measures of 
      clinical efficacy will eventually lead to higher chances of drug approval.

AB  - Down syndrome (DS) is caused by trisomy of chromosome 21, which leads to a 
      propensity to develop amyloid β (Aβ) brain pathology in early adulthood followed 
      later by cognitive and behavioral deterioration. Characterization of the Aβ 
      pathology is important to better understand the clinical deterioration of DS 
      individuals and to identify interventive strategies. Brain samples from people 
      with DS and Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as non-demented controls (NDC), 
      were analyzed with respect to different Aβ species. Immunohistochemical staining 
      using antibodies towards Aβ was also performed. Elevated levels of soluble Aβ 
      protofibrils and insoluble Aβx-40 and Aβx-42 in formic acid brain extracts, and 
      elevated immunohistochemical staining of Aβ deposits were demonstrated with the 
      antibody BAN2401 (lecanemab) in DS and AD compared with NDC. These data and the 
      promising data in a large phase 2 CE clinical trial with lecanemab suggest that 
      lecanemab may have the potential to preserve cognitive capacity in DS. Lecanemab 
      is currently in a phase 3 CE clinical trial.

TI  - A randomized, double-blind, phase 2b proof-of-concept clinical trial in early 
      Alzheimer's disease with lecanemab, an anti-Aβ protofibril antibody.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lecanemab (BAN2401), an IgG1 monoclonal antibody, preferentially 
      targets soluble aggregated amyloid beta (Aβ), with activity across oligomers, 
      protofibrils, and insoluble fibrils. BAN2401-G000-201, a randomized double-blind 
      clinical trial, utilized a Bayesian design with response-adaptive randomization 
      to assess 3 doses across 2 regimens of lecanemab versus placebo in early 
      Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
      and mild AD dementia. METHODS: BAN2401-G000-201 aimed to establish the effective 
      dose 90% (ED90), defined as the simplest dose that achieves ≥90% of the maximum 
      treatment effect. The primary endpoint was Bayesian analysis of 12-month clinical 
      change on the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS) for the ED90 dose, 
      which required an 80% probability of ≥25% clinical reduction in decline versus 
      placebo. Key secondary endpoints included 18-month Bayesian and frequentist 
      analyses of brain amyloid reduction using positron emission tomography; clinical 
      decline on ADCOMS, Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum-of-Boxes (CDR-SB), and 
      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog14); changes in 
      CSF core biomarkers; and total hippocampal volume (HV) using volumetric magnetic 
      resonance imaging. RESULTS: A total of 854 randomized subjects were treated 
      (lecanemab, 609; placebo, 245). At 12 months, the 10-mg/kg biweekly ED90 dose 
      showed a 64% probability to be better than placebo by 25% on ADCOMS, which missed 
      the 80% threshold for the primary outcome. At 18 months, 10-mg/kg biweekly 
      lecanemab reduced brain amyloid (-0.306 SUVr units) while showing a drug-placebo 
      difference in favor of active treatment by 27% and 30% on ADCOMS, 56% and 47% on 
      ADAS-Cog14, and 33% and 26% on CDR-SB versus placebo according to Bayesian and 
      frequentist analyses, respectively. CSF biomarkers were supportive of a treatment 
      effect. Lecanemab was well-tolerated with 9.9% incidence of amyloid-related 
      imaging abnormalities-edema/effusion at 10 mg/kg biweekly. CONCLUSIONS: 
      BAN2401-G000-201 did not meet the 12-month primary endpoint. However, 
      prespecified 18-month Bayesian and frequentist analyses demonstrated reduction in 
      brain amyloid accompanied by a consistent reduction of clinical decline across 
      several clinical and biomarker endpoints. A phase 3 study (Clarity AD) in early 
      Alzheimer's disease is underway. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) immunotherapy with antibodies targeting 
      amyloid-β (Aβ) has been extensively explored in clinical trials. The aim of this 
      study was to study the long-term brain distribution of two radiolabeled 
      monoclonal Aβ antibody variants - RmAb158, the recombinant murine version of 
      BAN2401, which has recently demonstrated amyloid removal and reduced cognitive 
      decline in AD patients, and the bispecific RmAb158-scFv8D3, which has been 
      engineered for enhanced brain uptake via transferrin receptor-mediated 
      transcytosis. METHODS: A single intravenous injection of iodine-125 
      ((125)I)-labeled RmAb158-scFv8D3 or RmAb158 was administered to AD transgenic 
      mice (tg-ArcSwe). In vivo single-photon emission computed tomography was used to 
      investigate brain retention and intrabrain distribution of the antibodies over a 
      period of 4 weeks. Activity in blood and brain tissue was measured ex vivo and 
      autoradiography was performed in combination with Aβ and CD31 immunostaining to 
      investigate the intrabrain distribution of the antibodies and their interactions 
      with Aβ. RESULTS: Despite faster blood clearance, [(125)I]RmAb158-scFv8D3 
      displayed higher brain exposure than [(125)I]RmAb158 throughout the study. The 
      brain distribution of [(125)I]RmAb158-scFv8D3 was more uniform and coincided with 
      parenchymal Aβ pathology, while [(125)I]RmAb158 displayed a more scattered 
      distribution pattern and accumulated in central parts of the brain at later 
      times. Ex vivo autoradiography indicated greater vascular escape and parenchymal 
      Aβ interactions for [(125)I]RmAb158-scFv8D3, whereas [(125)I]RmAb158 displayed 
      retention and Aβ interactions in lateral ventricles. CONCLUSIONS: The high brain 
      uptake and uniform intrabrain distribution of RmAb158-scFv8D3 highlight the 
      benefits of receptor-mediated transcytosis for antibody-based brain imaging. 
      Moreover, it suggests that the alternative transport route of the bispecific 
      antibody contributes to improved efficacy of brain-directed immunotherapy.

      Auspicious New Ways for Alzheimer's Disease.

LID - 5858
AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder related 
      to age, characterized by the cerebral deposition of fibrils, which are made from 
      the amyloid-β (Aβ), a peptide of 40-42 amino acids. The conversion of Aβ into 
      neurotoxic oligomeric, fibrillar, and protofibrillar assemblies is supposed to be 
      the main pathological event in AD. After Aβ accumulation, the clinical symptoms 
      fall out predominantly due to the deficient brain clearance of the peptide. For 
      several years, researchers have attempted to decline the Aβ monomer, oligomer, 
      and aggregate levels, as well as plaques, employing agents that facilitate the 
      reduction of Aβ and antagonize Aβ aggregation, or raise Aβ clearance from brain. 
      Unluckily, broad clinical trials with mild to moderate AD participants have shown 
      that these approaches were unsuccessful. Several clinical trials are running 
      involving patients whose disease is at an early stage, but the preliminary 
      outcomes are not clinically impressive. Many studies have been conducted against 
      oligomers of Aβ which are the utmost neurotoxic molecular species. Trials with 
      monoclonal antibodies directed against Aβ oligomers have exhibited exciting 
      findings. Nevertheless, Aβ oligomers maintain equivalent states in both monomeric 
      and aggregation forms; so, previously administered drugs that precisely decrease 
      Aβ monomer or Aβ plaques ought to have displayed valuable clinical benefits. In 
      this article, Aβ-based therapeutic strategies are discussed and several promising 
      new ways to fight against AD are appraised.

      amyloid-targeting drugs for Alzheimer's disease with potential for near term 
      approval.

AB  - The body of evidence suggesting a causative, initiating role of beta amyloid (Aβ) 
      in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is substantial. Yet, only a few 
      anti-amyloid agents have shown meaningful efficacy in clinical trials. We 
      evaluated the unifying characteristics of anti-amyloid agents with positive 
      clinical or biomarker effects in long-duration trials and analyzed how 
      pharmacological characteristics determine their clinical product profiles. Four 
      agents with the potential for near term approval fulfill these criteria: the 
      injectable antibodies, aducanumab, gantenerumab, and BAN2401, and a small 
      molecule oral agent, ALZ-801. Aducanumab and BAN2401 showed significant efficacy 
      on both clinical and biomarker outcomes; gantenerumab showed significant 
      biomarker effects, with no clinical efficacy reported to date; and ALZ-801 showed 
      significant clinical effects in the high-risk population of patients homozygous 
      for the ε4 allele of apolipoprotein E gene (APOE4) and a dose-dependent 
      preservation of hippocampal volume. We explored how the pharmacological 
      properties of these agents, namely selectivity for Aβ oligomers, plasma 
      half-life, brain penetration, and time to peak brain exposure, determine their 
      clinical profiles. A crucial characteristic shared by these agents is their 
      ability to engage neurotoxic soluble Aβ oligomers, albeit to various degrees. 
      Aducanumab and gantenerumab partially target oligomers, while mostly clearing 
      insoluble amyloid plaques; BAN2401 preferentially targets soluble protofibrils 
      (large oligomers) over plaques; and ALZ-801 blocks the formation of oligomers 
      without binding to plaques. The degree of selectivity for Aβ oligomers and brain 
      exposure drive the magnitude and onset of clinical efficacy, while the clearance 
      of plaques is associated with vasogenic brain edema. Only the highest doses of 
      aducanumab and BAN2401 show modest efficacy, and higher dosing is limited by 
      increased risk of vasogenic edema, especially in APOE4 carriers. These 
      limitations can be avoided, and efficacy improved by small molecule agents that 
      selectively inhibit the formation or block the toxicity of Aβ oligomers without 
      clearing amyloid plaques. The most advanced selective anti-oligomer agent is 
      ALZ-801, an optimized oral prodrug of tramiprosate, which demonstrated efficacy 
      in homozygous APOE4/4 AD subjects. ALZ-801 selectively and fully inhibits the 
      formation of Aβ42 oligomers at the clinical dose, without evidence of vasogenic 
      edema, and will be evaluated in a phase 3 trial in homozygous APOE4/4 patients 
      with early AD. In addition to clinical measures, the phase 3 trial will include 
      cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and imaging biomarkers to gain further insights into 
      the role of soluble Aβ oligomers in the pathogenesis of AD and their impact on 
      disease progression.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Currently available Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics are only 
      symptomatic, targeting cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions. Several 
      putative disease-modifying drugs in late-stage clinical development target 
      amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and tau protein, the principal neurophatological hallmarks 
      of the disease. AREAS COVERED: Phase III randomized clinical trials of anti-Aβ 
      drugs for AD treatment were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and 
      principal biomedical databases until May 2020. EXPERT OPINION: At present, 
      compounds in Phase III clinical development for AD include four 
       anti-Ab monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab, aducanumab, BAN2401), 
      the combination of cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP1), and two small 
      molecules (levetiracetam, GV-971). These drugs are mainly being tested in 
      subjects during early AD phases or at preclinical stage of familial AD or even in 
      asymptomatic subjects at high risk of developing AD. The actual results support 
      the hypothesis that elevated Aβ represents an early stage in the AD continuum and 
      demonstrate the feasibility of enrolling these high-risk participants in 
      secondary prevention trials to slow cognitive decline during the AD preclinical 
      stages. However, a series of clinical failures may question further development 
      of Aβ-targeting drugs and the findings from current ongoing Phase III trials will 
      hopefully give light to this critical issue.

AB  - Amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau proteins currently represent the two most promising 
      targets to treat Alzheimer's disease. The most extensively developed method to 
      treat the pathologic forms of these proteins is through the administration of 
      exogenous antibodies, or passive immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the 
      molecular-level strategies that researchers are using to design an effective 
      therapeutic antibody, given the challenges in treating this disease. These 
      challenges include selectively targeting a protein that has misfolded or is 
      pathological rather than the more abundant, healthy protein, designing strategic 
      constructs for immunizing an animal to raise an antibody that has the appropriate 
      conformational selectivity to achieve this end, and clearing the pathological 
      protein species before prion-like cell-to-cell spread of misfolded protein has 
      irreparably damaged neurons, without invoking damaging inflammatory responses in 
      the brain that naturally arise when the innate immune system is clearing foreign 
      agents. The various solutions to these problems in current clinical trials will 
      be discussed.

AB  - Neuroinflammation commences decades before Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical 
      onset and represents one of the earliest pathomechanistic alterations throughout 
      the AD continuum. Large-scale genome-wide association studies point out several 
      genetic variants-TREM2, CD33, PILRA, CR1, MS4A, CLU, ABCA7, EPHA1, and 
      HLA-DRB5-HLA-DRB1-potentially linked to neuroinflammation. Most of these genes 
      are involved in proinflammatory intracellular signaling, 
      cytokines/interleukins/cell turnover, synaptic activity, lipid metabolism, and 
      vesicle trafficking. Proteomic studies indicate that a plethora of interconnected 
      aberrant molecular pathways, set off and perpetuated by TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-1β, and 
      the receptor protein TREM2, are involved in neuroinflammation. Microglia and 
      astrocytes are key cellular drivers and regulators of neuroinflammation. Under 
      physiological conditions, they are important for neurotransmission and synaptic 
      homeostasis. In AD, there is a turning point throughout its pathophysiological 
      evolution where glial cells sustain an overexpressed inflammatory response that 
      synergizes with amyloid-β and tau accumulation, and drives synaptotoxicity and 
      neurodegeneration in a self-reinforcing manner. Despite a strong therapeutic 
      rationale, previous clinical trials investigating compounds with 
      anti-inflammatory properties, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      (NSAIDs), did not achieve primary efficacy endpoints. It is conceivable that 
      study design issues, including the lack of diagnostic accuracy and biomarkers for 
      target population identification and proof of mechanism, may partially explain 
      the negative outcomes. However, a recent meta-analysis indicates a potential 
      biological effect of NSAIDs. In this regard, candidate fluid biomarkers of 
      neuroinflammation are under analytical/clinical validation, i.e., TREM2, IL-1β, 
      MCP-1, IL-6, TNF-α receptor complexes, TGF-β, and YKL-40. PET radio-ligands are 
      investigated to accomplish in vivo and longitudinal regional exploration of 
      neuroinflammation. Biomarkers tracking different molecular pathways (body fluid 
      matrixes) along with brain neuroinflammatory endophenotypes (neuroimaging 
      markers), can untangle temporal-spatial dynamics between neuroinflammation and 
      other AD pathophysiological mechanisms. Robust biomarker-drug codevelopment 
      pipelines are expected to enrich large-scale clinical trials testing 
      new-generation compounds active, directly or indirectly, on neuroinflammatory 
      targets and displaying putative disease-modifying effects: novel NSAIDs, AL002 
      (anti-TREM2 antibody), anti-Aβ protofibrils (BAN2401), and AL003 (anti-CD33 
      antibody). As a next step, taking advantage of breakthrough and multimodal 
      techniques coupled with a systems biology approach is the path to pursue for 
      developing individualized therapeutic strategies targeting neuroinflammation 
      under the framework of precision medicine.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Antiamyloid therapy of Alzheimer's disease tackles the 
      overproduction and clearance of the amyloid-beta peptide (Aβ). Immunotherapeutic 
      compounds were tested in large-scale trials. We revisit the recent literature 
      focusing on randomized-controlled trials (RCT) using monoclonal anti-Aβ 
      antibodies. RECENT FINDINGS: Forty-three articles on anti-Aβ passive 
      immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease were published between January 2016 and 
      October 2019 regarding 17 RCTs: 13 phase III trials using the monoclonal 
      antibodies bapineuzumab, solanezumab, gantenerumab, crenezumab, and aducanumab; 
      three phase II with crenezumab and aducanumab; and one phase I trial with 
      BAN2401. Studies resulted largely negative considering the effect of the 
      treatment on primary and secondary outcome variables. The incidence of the most 
      important adverse effect, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) ranged 
      between 0.2 and 22%, in treatment groups. Primary endpoints were not met in eight 
      trials, and five trials were discontinued prior to completion. SUMMARY: Passive 
      immunotherapy RCTs failed to show clinically relevant effects in patients with 
      clinically manifest or prodromal dementia. The high incidence of ARIAs indicates 
      that the risk of adverse events may outweigh the benefits of these interventions. 
      Ongoing studies must determine the benefit of such interventions in preclinical 
      Alzheimer's disease, addressing the effect of antiamyloid immunotherapy in 
      samples of asymptomatic carriers of autosomal-dominant mutations related to 
      early-onset Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Concordance of Lumipulse cerebrospinal fluid t-tau/Aβ42 ratio with amyloid PET 
      status.
PG  - 144-152
LID - 10.1002/alz.12000 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers can identify individuals with 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology (eg, amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary 
      tangles), but defined analyte cut-points using high-throughput automated assays 
      are necessary for general clinical use. METHODS: CSF amyloid β42 peptide (Aβ42), 
      t-tau, and t-tau/Aβ42 were quantified by the Lumipulse platform in two test 
      cohorts (A/B: Eisai BAN2401-201/MISSION AD E2609-301/302, n = 138; C: Knight 
      Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), n = 198), and receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curve analyses defined cut-points corresponding best to 
      amyloid determinations using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. The 
      best-performing cut-point was then validated as a predictor of amyloid status in 
      an independent cohort (D: MISSION AD E2609-301/302, n = 240). RESULTS: Virtually 
      identical t-tau/Aβ42 cut-points (∼0.54) performed best in both test cohorts and 
      with similar accuracy (areas under ROC curve [AUCs] [A/B: 0.95; C: 0.94]). The 
      cut-point yielded an overall percent agreement with amyloid PET of 85.0% in 
      validation cohort D. DISCUSSION: Lumipulse CSF biomarker measures with validated 
      cut-points have clinical utility in identifying AD pathology.

AB  - Development of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been 
      challenging, with no drugs approved to date. The failures of several 
      amyloid-targeted programs have led many to dismiss the amyloid beta (Aβ) 
      hypothesis of AD. An antiamyloid antibody aducanumab recently showed modest but 
      significant efficacy in a phase 3 trial, providing important validation of 
      amyloid as a therapeutic target. However, the inconsistent results observed with 
      aducanumab may be explained by the limited brain penetration and lack of 
      selectivity for the soluble Aβ oligomers, which are implicated as upstream 
      drivers of neurodegeneration by multiple studies. Development of agents that can 
      effectively inhibit Aβ oligomer formation or block their toxicity is therefore 
      warranted. An ideal drug would cross the blood-brain barrier efficiently and 
      achieve sustained brain levels that can continuously prevent oligomer formation 
      or inhibit their toxicity. A late-stage candidate with these attributes is 
      ALZ-801, an oral drug with a favorable safety profile and high brain penetration 
      that can robustly inhibit Aβ oligomer formation. An upcoming phase 3 trial with 
      ALZ-801 in APOE4/4 homozygous patients with early AD will effectively test this 
      amyloid oligomer hypothesis.

AB  - The apparently near-term effects of the monoclonal antibody BAN2401 in slowing 
      the progression of prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) has created cautious 
      optimism about the therapeutic use of antibodies that neutralize cytotoxic 
      soluble amyloid-β aggregates, rather than removing plaque. Plaque being 
      protective, as it immobilizes cytotoxic amyloid-β, rather than AD's causative 
      agent. The presence of natural antibodies against cytotoxic amyloid-β implies the 
      existence of a protective anti-AD immunity. Hence, for vaccines to induce a 
      similar immunoresponse that prevents and/or delays the onset of AD, they must 
      have adjuvants that stimulate a sole anti-inflammatory Th2 immunity, plus 
      immunogens that induce a protective immunoresponse against diverse cytotoxic 
      amyloid-β conformers. Indeed, amyloid-β pleomorphism may explain the lack of 
      long-term protection by monoclonal antibodies that neutralize single conformers, 
      like aducanumab. A situation that would allow new cytotoxic conformers to escape 
      neutralization by previously effective monoclonal antibodies. Stimulation of a 
      vaccine's effective immunoresponse would require the concurrent delivery of 
      immunogen to dendritic cells and their priming, to induce a polarized Th2 
      immunity. An immunoresponse that would produce besides neutralizing antibodies 
      against neurotoxic amyloid-β oligomers, anti-inflammatory cytokines; preventing 
      inflammation that aggravates AD. Because of age-linked immune decline, vaccines 
      would be significantly more effective in preventing, rather than treating AD. 
      Considering the amyloid-β's role in tau's pathological hyperphosphorylation and 
      their synergism in AD, the development of preventive vaccines against both 
      amyloid-β and tau should be considered. Due to convenience and cost, vaccines may 
      be the only option available to many countries to forestall the impending AD 
      epidemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anti-amyloid β (Aβ) immunotherapy represents a major area of drug 
      development for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, Aβ peptide adopts multiple 
      conformations and the pathological forms to be specifically targeted have not 
      been identified. Aβ immunotherapy-related vasogenic edema has also been severely 
      dose limiting for antibodies with effector functions binding vascular amyloid 
      such as bapineuzumab. These two factors might have contributed to the limited 
      efficacy demonstrated so far in clinical studies. METHODS: To address these 
      limitations, we have engineered SAR228810, a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) 
      with limited Fc effector functions that binds specifically to soluble 
      protofibrillar and fibrillar forms of Aβ peptide and we tested it together with 
      its murine precursor SAR255952 in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Unlike gantenerumab 
      and BAN2401, SAR228810 and SAR255952 do not bind to Aβ monomers, low molecular 
      weight Aβ oligomers or, in human brain sections, to Aβ diffuse deposits which are 
      not specific of AD pathology. Both antibodies prevent Aβ42 oligomer neurotoxicity 
      in primary neuronal cultures. In vivo, SAR255952, a mouse aglycosylated IgG1, 
      dose-dependently prevented brain amyloid plaque formation and plaque-related 
      inflammation with a minimal active dose of 3 mg/kg/week by the intraperitoneal 
      route. No increase in plasma Aβ levels was observed with SAR255952 treatment, in 
      line with its lack of affinity for monomeric Aβ. The effects of SAR255952 
      translated into synaptic functional improvement in ex-vivo hippocampal slices. 
      Brain penetration and decoration of cerebral amyloid plaques was documented in 
      live animals and postmortem. SAR255952 (up to 50 mg/kg/week intravenously) did 
      not increase brain microhemorrhages and/or microscopic changes in meningeal and 
      cerebral arteries in old APPSL mice while 3D6, the murine version of 
      bapineuzumab, did. In immunotolerized mice, the clinical candidate SAR228810 
      demonstrated the same level of efficacy as the murine SAR255952. CONCLUSION: 
      Based on the improved efficacy/safety profile in non-clinical models of 
      SAR228810, a first-in-man single and multiple dose administration clinical study 
      has been initiated in AD patients.

TI  - The Aβ protofibril selective antibody mAb158 prevents accumulation of Aβ in 
      astrocytes and rescues neurons from Aβ-induced cell death.
PG  - 98
LID - 10.1186/s12974-018-1134-4 [doi]
LID - 98
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, several amyloid beta (Aβ) antibodies, including the 
      protofibril selective antibody BAN2401, are in clinical trials. The murine 
      version of BAN2401, mAb158, has previously been shown to lower the levels of 
      pathogenic Aβ and prevent Aβ deposition in animal models of Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). However, the cellular mechanisms of the antibody's action remain unknown. 
      We have recently shown that astrocytes effectively engulf Aβ(42) protofibrils, 
      but store rather than degrade the ingested Aβ aggregates. In a co-culture set-up, 
      the incomplete degradation of Aβ(42) protofibrils by astrocytes results in 
      increased neuronal cell death, due to the release of extracellular vesicles, 
      containing N-truncated, neurotoxic Aβ. METHODS: The aim of the present study was 
      to investigate if the accumulation of Aβ in astrocytes can be affected by the Aβ 
      protofibril selective antibody mAb158. Co-cultures of astrocytes, neurons, and 
      oligodendrocytes, derived from embryonic mouse cortex, were exposed to Aβ(42) 
      protofibrils in the presence or absence of mAb158. RESULTS: Our results 
      demonstrate that the presence of mAb158 almost abolished Aβ accumulation in 
      astrocytes. Consequently, mAb158 treatment rescued neurons from Aβ-induced cell 
      death. CONCLUSION: Based on these findings, we conclude that astrocytes may play 
      a central mechanistic role in anti-Aβ immunotherapy.

TI  - The potential of solanezumab and gantenerumab to prevent Alzheimer's disease in 
      people with inherited mutations that cause its early onset.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The recent failure of several clinical trials on anti-β-amyloid 
      (Aβ) drugs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) suggested earlier intervention in the 
      disease course. Secondary prevention trials have been started in 
      autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD) individuals without cognitive dysfunction and in 
      cognitively healthy subjects at risk of developing sporadic AD (SAD). AREAS 
      COVERED: Herein, the authors discuss prevention trials in ADAD and SAD, with a 
      focus on the anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies solanezumab and gantenerumab presently 
      in Phase III clinical development. These therapies are also being tested in the 
      Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network Trials Unit (DIAN-TU). EXPERT OPINION: 
      Anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies are being tested in subjects at the preclinical 
      stage of ADAD and even in symptom-free subjects at risk of developing SAD. The 
      subsequent DIAN-TU Adaptive Prevention Trial is a 4-year study that will assess 
      whether such biomarker effects may stop the progress of the AD process, 
      preventing cognitive symptoms. The hope is to interfere in the disease course 
      when it is not too late. A clinical success of these prevention trials would 
      represent the proof of the Aβ hypothesis of AD.

TI  - Safety and tolerability of BAN2401--a clinical study in Alzheimer's disease with 
      a protofibril selective Aβ antibody.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
      disease (AD) have been in development over the last decade. BAN2401 is a 
      monoclonal antibody that selectively binds soluble amyloid β (Aβ) protofibrils. 
      METHODS: Here we describe the first clinical study with BAN2401. Safety and 
      tolerability were investigated in mild to moderate AD. A study design was used 
      with staggered parallel single and multiple ascending doses, from 0.1 mg/kg as a 
      single dose to 10 mg/kg biweekly for four months. The presence of amyloid related 
      imaging abnormalities (ARIA, E for edema, H for hemorrhage) was assessed with 
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples 
      were analyzed to investigate pharmacokinetics (PK) and effects on biomarkers. 
      RESULTS: The incidence of ARIA-E/H on MRI was comparable to that of placebo. 
      BAN2401 exposure was approximately dose proportional, with a serum terminal 
      elimination half-life of ~7 days. Only a slight increase of plasma Aβ(1-40) was 
      observed but there were no measurable effects of BAN2401 on CSF biomarkers. On 
      the basis of these findings Phase 2b efficacy study has been initiated in early 
      AD. CONCLUSIONS: BAN2401 was well-tolerated across all doses. The PK profile has 
      guided us for selecting dose and dose regimens in the ongoing phase 2b study. 
      There was no clear guidance for an effective dose based on biomarkers. TRIAL

TI  - Design of a Bayesian adaptive phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for BAN2401, a 
      putative disease-modifying monoclonal antibody for the treatment of Alzheimer's 
      disease.
PG  - 1-12
LID - 10.1016/j.trci.2016.01.001 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recent failures in phase 3 clinical trials in Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) suggest that novel approaches to drug development are urgently needed. Phase 
      3 risk can be mitigated by ensuring that clinical efficacy is established before 
      initiating confirmatory trials, but traditional phase 2 trials in AD can be 
      lengthy and costly. METHODS: We designed a Bayesian adaptive phase 2, 
      proof-of-concept trial with a clinical endpoint to evaluate BAN2401, a monoclonal 
      antibody targeting amyloid protofibrils. The study design used dose response and 
      longitudinal modeling. Simulations were used to refine study design features to 
      achieve optimal operating characteristics. RESULTS: The study design includes 
      five active treatment arms plus placebo, a clinical outcome, 12-month primary 
      endpoint, and a maximum sample size of 800. The average overall probability of 
      success is ≥80% when at least one dose shows a treatment effect that would be 
      considered clinically meaningful. Using frequent interim analyses, the 
      randomization ratios are adapted based on the clinical endpoint, and the trial 
      can be stopped for success or futility before full enrollment. DISCUSSION: 
      Bayesian statistics can enhance the efficiency of analyzing the study data. The 
      adaptive randomization generates more data on doses that appear to be more 
      efficacious, which can improve dose selection for phase 3. The interim analyses 
      permit stopping as soon as a predefined signal is detected, which can accelerate 
      decision making. Both features can reduce the size and duration of the trial. 
      This study design can mitigate some of the risks associated with advancing to 
      phase 3 in the absence of data demonstrating clinical efficacy. Limitations to 
      the approach are discussed.

AB  - Amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has good preclinical 
      support from transgenic mouse models and clinical data suggesting that a 
      long-term treatment effect is possible. Soluble Aβ protofibrils have been shown 
      to exhibit neurotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, and constitute an attractive 
      target for immunotherapy. Here, we demonstrate that the humanized antibody 
      BAN2401 and its murine version mAb158 exhibit a strong binding preference for Aβ 
      protofibrils over Aβ monomers. Further, we confirm the presence of the target by 
      showing that both antibodies efficiently immunoprecipitate soluble Aβ aggregates 
      in human AD brain extracts. mAb158 reached the brain and reduced the brain 
      protofibril levels by 42% in an exposure-dependent manner both after long-term 
      and short-term treatment in tg-ArcSwe mice. Notably, a 53% reduction of 
      protofibrils/oligomers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that correlated with reduced 
      brain protofibril levels was observed after long-term treatment, suggesting that 
      CSF protofibrils/oligomers could be used as a potential biomarker. No change in 
      native monomeric Aβ42 could be observed in brain TBS extracts after 
      mAb158-treatment in tg-ArcSwe mice. By confirming the specific ability of mAb158 
      to selectively bind and reduce soluble Aβ protofibrils, with minimal binding to 
      Aβ monomers, we provide further support in favor of its position as an attractive 
      new candidate for AD immunotherapy. BAN2401 has undergone full phase 1 
      development, and available data indicate a favorable safety profile in AD 
      patients.

AB  - The symptomatic drugs currently on the market for Alzheimer's disease (AD) have 
      no effect on disease progression, and this creates a large unmet medical need. 
      The type of drug that has developed most rapidly in the last decade is 
      immunotherapy: vaccines and, especially, passive vaccination with monoclonal 
      antibodies. Antibodies are attractive drugs as they can be made highly specific 
      for their target and often with few side effects. Data from recent clinical AD 
      trials indicate that a treatment effect by immunotherapy is possible, providing 
      hope for a new generation of drugs. The first anti-amyloid-beta (anti-Aβ) vaccine 
      developed by Elan, AN1792, was halted in phase 2 because of aseptic 
      meningoencephalitis. However, in a follow-up study, patients with antibody 
      response to the vaccine demonstrated reduced cognitive decline, supporting the 
      hypothesis that Aβ immunotherapy may have clinically relevant effects. 
      Bapineuzumab (Elan/Pfizer Inc./Johnson & Johnson), a monoclonal antibody 
      targeting fibrillar Aβ, was stopped because the desired clinical effect was not 
      seen. Solanezumab (Eli Lilly and Company) was developed to target soluble, 
      monomeric Aβ. In two phase 3 studies, Solanezumab did not meet primary endpoints. 
      When data from the two studies were pooled, a positive pattern emerged, revealing 
      a significant slowing of cognitive decline in the subgroup of mild AD. The Arctic 
      mutation has been shown to specifically increase the formation of soluble Aβ 
      protofibrils, an Aβ species shown to be toxic to neurons and likely to be present 
      in all cases of AD. A monoclonal antibody, mAb158, was developed to target Aβ 
      protofibrils with high selectivity. It has at least a 1,000-fold higher 
      selectivity for protofibrils as compared with monomers of Aβ, thus targeting the 
      toxic species of the peptide. A humanized version of mAb158, BAN2401, has now 
      entered a clinical phase 2b trial in a collaboration between BioArctic 
      Neuroscience and Eisai without the safety concerns seen in previous phase 1 and 
      2a trials. Experiences from the field indicate the importance of initiating 
      treatment early in the course of the disease and of enriching the trial 
      population by improving the diagnostic accuracy. BAN2401 is a promising candidate 
      for Aβ immunotherapy in early AD. Other encouraging efforts in immunotherapy as 
      well as in the small-molecule field offer hope for new innovative therapies for 
      AD in the future.

AB  - In order to avoid Abeta-induced autoimmune encephalitis, several monoclonal and 
      polyclonal antibodies are in clinical trials. These are bapineuzumab, 
      solanezumab, ponezumab, gantenerumab, BAN2401, gammaguard and octagam. Since each 
      antibody has a different antigen epitope of Abeta, anti-amyloid activities are 
      different. It is unknown which antibody is effective for Alzheimer disease, and 
      we must wait for the result of clinical trials. Some patients who developed 
      tissue amyloid plaque immuno-reactive (TAPIR) antibody showed slower decline 
      after AN-1792 vaccination. We developed TAPIR-like monoclonal antibody, which was 
      found to react with Abeta oligomers preferentially.
