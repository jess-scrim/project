              neurodegeneration within Alzheimer's Disease pathogenesis are not
              fully understood. To explore these associations in vivo, we
              evaluated 30 A$\beta$ PET-positive patients (mean $\pm$ sd age
              62.4 $\pm$ 8.3) with mild probable AD and 12 A$\beta$
              PET-negative healthy controls (HC) (mean $\pm$ sd age 77.3 $\pm$
              6.9) as comparison. All participants underwent 3 T MRI, 11C-PiB
              (A$\beta$) PET and 18F-AV1451 (tau) PET. Multimodal correlation
              analyses were run at both voxel- and region-of-interest levels.
              11C-PiB retention in AD showed the most diffuse uptake pattern
              throughout association neocortex, whereas 18F-AV1451 and gray
              matter volume reduction (GMR) showed a progressive predilection
              for posterior cortices (p<0.05 Family-Wise
              Error-[FWE]-corrected). Voxel-level analysis identified negative
              correlations between 18F-AV1451 and gray matter peaking in medial
              and infero-occipital regions (p<0.01 False Discovery
              Rate-[FDR]-corrected). 18F-AV1451 and 11C-PiB were positively
              correlated in right parietal and medial/inferior occipital
              regions (p<0.001 uncorrected). 11C-PiB did not correlate with GMR
              at the voxel-level. Regionally, 18F-AV1451 was largely associated
              with local/adjacent GMR whereas frontal 11C-PiB correlated with
              GMR in posterior regions. These findings suggest that, in mild
              AD, tau aggregation drives local neurodegeneration, whereas the
              relationships between A$\beta$ and neurodegeneration are not
              region specific and may be mediated by the interaction between
              A$\beta$ and tau.",

              on the pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostic methods and
              therapeutic approach to AD. Currently, the amyloid cascade
              hypothesis remains the leading theory in the pathophysiology of
              AD. This hypothesis states that amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$)
              deposition triggers a chemical cascade of events leading to the
              development of AD dementia. The antemortem diagnosis of AD is
              still based on clinical parameters. Diagnostic procedures in AD
              include fluid-based biomarkers such as those present in
              cerebrospinal fluid and plasma or diagnostic imaging methods.
              Currently, the therapeutic armory available focuses on symptom
              control and is based on four pillars: pharmacological treatment
              where acetylcholinesterase inhibitors stand out; pharmacological
              treatment under investigation which includes drugs focused on the
              control of A$\beta$ pathology and tau hyperphosphorylation;
              treatment focusing on risk factors such as diabetes; or
              nonpharmacological treatments aimed at preventing development of
              the disease or treating symptoms through occupational therapy or
              psychological help. AD remains a largely unknown disease. Further

              such as technological and transportation infrastructures, social
              phenomena, and biological systems. These highly interconnected
              systems have recently been the focus of a great deal of attention
              that has uncovered and characterized their topological
              complexity. Along with a complex topological structure, real
              networks display a large heterogeneity in the capacity and
              intensity of the connections. These features, however, have
              mainly not been considered in past studies where links are
              usually represented as binary states, i.e., either present or
              absent. Here, we study the scientific collaboration network and
              the world-wide air-transportation network, which are
              representative examples of social and large infrastructure
              systems, respectively. In both cases it is possible to assign to
              each edge of the graph a weight proportional to the intensity or
              capacity of the connections among the various elements of the
              network. We define appropriate metrics combining weighted and
              topological observables that enable us to characterize the
              complex statistical properties and heterogeneity of the actual
              strength of edges and vertices. This information allows us to
              investigate the correlations among weighted quantities and the
              underlying topological structure of the network. These results

  abstract = "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia,
              presenting a significant unmet medical need worldwide. The
              pathogenesis of AD involves various pathophysiological events,
              including the accumulation of amyloid and tau,
              neuro-inflammation, and neuronal injury. Clinical trials focusing
              on new drugs for AD were documented in 2020, but subsequent
              developments have emerged since then. Notably, the US-FDA has

  abstract = "This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's
              disease, including prevalence and incidence, mortality and
              morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on
              family caregivers, the dementia workforce and society. The
              Special Report examines the patient journey from awareness of
              cognitive changes to potential treatment with drugs that change
              the underlying biology of Alzheimer's. An estimated 6.7 million
              Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia
              today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the
              development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD.
              Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in
              2019, and Alzheimer's disease was officially listed as the
              sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. In 2020 and
              2021, when COVID-19 entered the ranks of the top ten causes of
              death, Alzheimer's was the seventh-leading cause of death.
              Alzheimer's remains the fifth-leading cause of death among
              Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from
              stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths
              from AD increased more than 145\%. This trajectory of deaths from
              AD was likely exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and
              2021. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid
              caregivers provided an estimated 18 billion hours of care to
              people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2022. These figures
              reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a
              decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care
              provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving
              was valued at $339.5 billion in 2022. Its costs, however, extend
              to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and
              negative mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have
              been aggravated by COVID-19. Members of the paid health care
              workforce are involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for
              people with dementia. In recent years, however, a shortage of
              such workers has developed in the United States. This shortage -
              brought about, in part, by COVID-19 - has occurred at a time when
              more members of the dementia care workforce are needed.
              Therefore, programs will be needed to attract workers and better
              train health care teams. Average per-person Medicare payments for
              services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other
              dementias are almost three times as great as payments for
              beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are
              more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2023 for health
              care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and
              older with dementia are estimated to be $345 billion. The Special
              Report examines whether there will be sufficient numbers of
              physician specialists to provide Alzheimer's care and treatment
              now that two drugs are available that change the underlying
              biology of Alzheimer's disease.",

               methods is rapidly declining, enabling new possibilities for all

  abstract = "Background Tremendous research efforts have been made in the
              Alzheimer's disease (AD) field to understand the disease
              etiology, progression and discover treatments for AD. Many
              mechanistic hypotheses, therapeutic targets and treatment
              strategies have been proposed in the last few decades. Reviewing
              previous work and staying current on this ever-growing body of AD
              publications is an essential yet difficult task for AD
              researchers. Methods In this study, we designed and implemented a
              natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to extract
              gene-specific neurodegenerative disease (ND) -focused information
              from the PubMed database. The collected publication information
              was filtered and cleaned to construct AD-related gene-specific
              publication profiles. Six categories of AD-related information
              are extracted from the processed publication data: publication
              trend by year, dementia type occurrence, brain region occurrence,
              mouse model information, keywords occurrence, and co-occurring
              genes. A user-friendly web portal is then developed using Django
              framework to provide gene query functions and data visualizations
              for the generalized and summarized publication information.
              Results By implementing the NLP pipeline, we extracted
              gene-specific ND-related publication information from the
              abstracts of the publications in the PubMed database. The results
              are summarized and visualized through an interactive web query
              portal. Multiple visualization windows display the ND publication
              trends, mouse models used, dementia types, involved brain
              regions, keywords to major AD-related biological processes, and
              co-occurring genes. Direct links to PubMed sites are provided for
              all recorded publications on the query result page of the web
              portal. Conclusion The resulting portal is a valuable tool and
              data source for quick querying and displaying AD publications
              tailored to users' interested research areas and gene targets,
              which is especially convenient for users without informatic
              mining skills. Our study will not only keep AD field researchers
              updated with the progress of AD research, assist them in
              conducting preliminary examinations efficiently, but also offers
              additional support for hypothesis generation and validation which
              will contribute significantly to the communication, dissimilation

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Similar to most chronic diseases, Alzheimer's disease
              (AD) develops slowly from a preclinical phase into a fully
              expressed clinical syndrome. We aimed to use longitudinal data to
              calculate the rates of amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) deposition,
              cerebral atrophy, and cognitive decline. METHODS: In this
              prospective cohort study, healthy controls, patients with mild
              cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with AD were assessed at
              enrolment and every 18 months. At every visit, participants
              underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI, and a
              carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) PET scan. We
              included participants with three or more (11)C-PiB PET follow-up
              assessments. A$\beta$ burden was expressed as (11)C-PiB
              standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) with the cerebellar cortex
              as reference region. An SUVR of 1·5 was used to discriminate high
              from low A$\beta$ burdens. The slope of the regression plots over
              3-5 years was used to estimate rates of change for A$\beta$
              deposition, MRI volumetrics, and cognition. We included those
              participants with a positive rate of A$\beta$ deposition to
              calculate the trajectory of each variable over time. FINDINGS:
              200 participants (145 healthy controls, 36 participants with MCI,
              and 19 participants with AD) were assessed at enrolment and every
              18 months for a mean follow-up of 3·8 (95\% CI CI 3·6-3·9) years.
              At baseline, significantly higher A$\beta$ burdens were noted in
              patients with AD (2·27, SD 0·43) and those with MCI (1·94, 0·64)
              than in healthy controls (1·38, 0·39). At follow-up, 163 (82\%)
              of the 200 participants showed positive rates of A$\beta$
              accumulation. A$\beta$ deposition was estimated to take 19·2
              (95\% CI 16·8-22·5) years in an almost linear fashion-with a mean
              increase of 0·043 (95\% CI 0·037-0·049) SUVR per year-to go from
              the threshold of (11)C-PiB positivity (1·5 SUVR) to the levels
              observed in AD. It was estimated to take 12·0 (95\% CI 10·1-14·9)
              years from the levels observed in healthy controls with low
              A$\beta$ deposition (1·2 [SD 0·1] SUVR) to the threshold of
              (11)C-PiB positivity. As AD progressed, the rate of A$\beta$
              deposition slowed towards a plateau. Our projections suggest a
              prolonged preclinical phase of AD in which A$\beta$ deposition
              reaches our threshold of positivity at 17·0 (95\% CI 14·9-19·9)
              years, hippocampal atrophy at 4·2 (3·6-5·1) years, and memory
              impairment at 3·3 (2·5-4·5) years before the onset of dementia
              (clinical dementia rating score 1). INTERPRETATION: A$\beta$
              deposition is slow and protracted, likely to extend for more than
              two decades. Such predictions of the rate of preclinical changes
              and the onset of the clinical phase of AD will facilitate the
              design and timing of therapeutic interventions aimed at modifying
              the course of this illness. FUNDING: Science and Industry

  abstract  = "Abstract Systematic review, meta-analysis and other forms of
               evidence synthesis are critical to strengthen the evidence base
               concerning conservation issues and to answer ecological and
               evolutionary questions. Synthesis lags behind the pace of
               scientific publishing, however, due to time and resource costs
               which partial automation of evidence synthesis tasks could
               reduce. Additionally, current methods of retrieving evidence for
               synthesis are susceptible to bias towards studies with which
               researchers are familiar. In fields that lack standardized
               terminology encoded in an ontology, including ecology and
               evolution, research teams can unintentionally exclude articles
               from the review by omitting synonymous phrases in their search
               terms. To combat these problems, we developed a quick,
               objective, reproducible method for generating search strategies
               that uses text mining and keyword co-occurrence networks to
               identify the most important terms for a review. The method
               reduces bias in search strategy development because it does not
               rely on a predetermined set of articles and can improve search
               recall by identifying synonymous terms that research teams might
               otherwise omit. When tested against the search strategies used
               in published environmental systematic reviews, our method
               performs as well as the published searches and retrieves
               gold-standard hits that replicated versions of the original
               searches do not. Because the method is quasi-automated, the
               amount of time required to develop a search strategy, conduct
               searches, and assemble results is reduced from approximately
               17?34 hr to under 2 hr. To facilitate use of the method for
               environmental evidence synthesis, we implemented the method in
               the R package litsearchr, which also contains a suite of
               functions to improve efficiency of systematic reviews by

               Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). Yet, most research is
               undermined by low interpretability and specificity. METHODS:
               Combining statistical and machine learning analyses of natural
               speech data, we aimed to discriminate ADD patients from healthy
               controls (HCs) based on automated measures of domains typically
               affected in ADD: semantic granularity (coarseness of concepts)
               and ongoing semantic variability (conceptual closeness of
               successive words). To test for specificity, we replicated the
               analyses on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. RESULTS: Relative
               to controls, ADD (but not PD) patients exhibited significant
               differences in both measures. Also, these features robustly
               discriminated between ADD patients and HC, while yielding
               near-chance classification between PD patients and HCs.
               DISCUSSION: Automated discourse-level semantic analyses can
               reveal objective, interpretable, and specific markers of ADD,

              comprehensive and semantic representation for heterogeneous data,
              and have been successfully leveraged in many biomedical
              applications including drug repurposing. Our objective is to
              construct a knowledge graph from literature to study the
              relations between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chemicals, drugs
              and dietary supplements in order to identify opportunities to
              prevent or delay neurodegenerative progression. We collected
              biomedical annotations and extracted their relations using SemRep
              via SemMedDB. We used both a BERT-based classifier and rule-based
              methods during data preprocessing to exclude noise while
              preserving most AD-related semantic triples. The 1,672,110
              filtered triples were used to train with knowledge graph
              completion algorithms (i.e., TransE, DistMult, and ComplEx) to
              predict candidates that might be helpful for AD treatment or
              prevention. RESULTS: Among three knowledge graph completion
              models, TransE outperformed the other two (MR = 10.53, Hits@1 =
              0.28). We leveraged the time-slicing technique to further
              evaluate the prediction results. We found supporting evidence for
              most highly ranked candidates predicted by our model which
              indicates that our approach can inform reliable new knowledge.
              CONCLUSION: This paper shows that our graph mining model can
              predict reliable new relationships between AD and other entities
              (i.e., dietary supplements, chemicals, and drugs). The knowledge

              writings looking at word choice and affect compared to those with
              and without dementia. The differences found in this analysis
              mirror the expected patterns where writings of people with
              dementia reflect significantly more analytical thinking words,
              but significantly less authentic and emotional tone. In addition,
              the analysis found that people with dementia use significantly
              less functional words, such as grammar, and affections
              (happiness, sadness, anger, sadness), but tend to use
              significantly more pronouns in their writings. Written samples of
              those with dementia also use significantly less time-oriented
              words that indicate past, present, or future. The analysis of
              free form text suggests a potential avenue for detecting early
              changes that correlate with dementia, allowing for early

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most widespread form
              of dementia in the elderly but despite progress made in recent
              years towards a mechanistic understanding, there is still an
              urgent need for disease modification therapy and for early
              diagnostic tests. Substantial international efforts are being
              made to discover and validate biomarkers for AD using candidate
              analytes and various data-driven 'omics' approaches.
              Cerebrospinal fluid is in many ways the tissue of choice for
              biomarkers of brain disease but is limited by patient and
              clinician acceptability, and increasing attention is being paid
              to the search for blood-based biomarkers. The aim of this study
              was to use a novel in silico approach to discover a set of
              candidate biomarkers for AD. METHODS: We used an in silico
              literature mining approach to identify potential biomarkers by
              creating a summarized set of assertional metadata derived from
              relevant legacy information. We then assessed the validity of
              this approach using direct assays of the identified biomarkers in
              plasma by immunodetection methods. RESULTS: Using this in silico
              approach, we identified 25 biomarker candidates, at least three
              of which have subsequently been reported to be altered in blood
              or CSF from AD patients. Two further candidate biomarkers,
              indicated from the in silico approach, were choline
              acetyltransferase and urokinase-type plasminogen activator
              receptor. Using immunodetection, we showed that, in a large
              sample set, these markers are either altered in disease or
              correlate with MRI markers of atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: These data
              support as a proof of concept the use of data mining and in
              silico analyses to derive valid biomarker candidates for AD and,
              by extension, for other disorders.",

              analysis, supervised similarity assessments, and latent Dirichlet
              allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Abstracts were classified by
              scope of their respective journals, then compared across fields.
              Mechanistic keywords pertained to four broad categories. Chemical
              keywords were also classified, with commercial drugs exhibiting

              clinical suspicion of dementia",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Given the phenomenon of aging
              population, dementias arise as a complex health problem
              throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have
              been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its
              diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing
              patients with some type of dementia from healthy people.
              Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively
              impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family.
              This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the
              mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This
              model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients
              with clinical suspicion of dementia. METHODS: The experiments
              were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19
              different attributes about patients with cognitive decline
              reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a
              text mining process. It was the result of clustering the
              patient's pathological history information stored in an
              unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms
              (na{\"\i}ve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees)
              were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive
              impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting
              and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of
              the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets:
              one containing only the original structured data; the other
              containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the
              new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
              RESULTS: The models' accuracy metrics obtained from the two
              different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the
              greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic
              prediction for the pathologies of interest. CONCLUSIONS: When
              analysing the different methods of classification and clustering
              used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity
              of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models
              with support of ensemble methods.",
