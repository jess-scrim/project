              association between $\beta$-amyloid or tau and rates of
              hippocampal atrophy in patients with Alzheimer's disease. TAR DNA
              binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is another protein linked to
              Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to investigate whether hippocampal
              TDP-43 is associated with increased rates of hippocampal atrophy.
              METHODS: In this longitudinal retrospective study, we analysed
              post-mortem brain tissue of all individuals with an Alzheimer's
              disease spectrum pathological diagnosis who had antemortem head
              MRI scans between Jan 1, 1999, and Dec 31, 2012, and who had been
              recruited into the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research
              Center, Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry, or the
              Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We did TDP-43 immunohistochemistry
              and classified individuals as follows: no TDP-43 in the amygdala
              or hippocampus; TDP-43 restricted to the amygdala; and TDP-43
              spreading into the hippocampus. Each individual was also assigned
              a neurofibrillary tangle stage (B1-B3), relating to the
              likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease. We used longitudinal
              FreeSurfer software and tensor-based morphometry with symmetric
              normalisation to calculate hippocampal volume on all serial MRI
              scans and used linear mixed-effects regression models to estimate
              associations between TDP-43 and rate of hippocampal atrophy and
              to assess the trajectory of TDP-43-associated atrophy. FINDINGS:
              We identified 298 individuals meeting the inclusion criteria,
              with 816 usable MRI scans (spanning 1·0-11·2 years of the
              disease) available for analysis. 141 individuals showed no TDP-43
              in the amygdala or hippocampus, 33 had TDP-43 restricted to the
              amygdala, and 124 had TDP-43 in the hippocampus. Among
              individuals with a high likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease
              (neurofibrillary tangle stage B3; n=205), those with hippocampal
              TDP-43 had faster rates of hippocampal atrophy (n=103, annual
              volume change -4·39\%, 95\% CI -4·82 to -3·95; p<0·0001) than did
              those with amygdala-only TDP-43 (n=20, -3·29\%, -4·11 to -2·46;
              p<0·0001; difference -1·10\%, 95\% CI -2·02 to -0·19; p=0·02) and
              those without TDP-43 (n=82, -3·11\%, -3·54 to -2·68; p<0·0001;
              difference -1·28\%, -1·88 to -0·67; p<0·0001). Among individuals
              with an intermediate likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease
              (neurofibrillary tangle stage B2; n=56), those with hippocampal
              TDP-43 had faster rates of hippocampal atrophy (n=17, annual
              volume change -4·05\%, 95\% CI -5·09 to -2·99; p<0·0001) than did
              those with amygdala-only TDP-43 (n=6, -1·78\%, -3·04 to -0·55;
              p=0·004; difference -2·27\%, 95\% CI -3·79 to -0·67; p=0·006) and
              those without TDP-43 (n=33, -1·63\%, -2·43 to -0·83; p=0·0002;
              difference -2·43\%, -3·66 to -1·18; p=0·0002). Hippocampal TDP-43
              was not associated with the rate of hippocampal atrophy in
              individuals with a low likelihood of having Alzheimer's disease
              (neurofibrillary tangle stage B1; n=37). The trajectory analysis
              suggested that increased rates of TDP-43-associated hippocampal
              atrophy might occur at least 10 years before death. Results were
              similar for FreeSurfer and tensor-based morphometry.
              INTERPRETATION: TDP-43 should be considered as a potential factor
              related to increased rates of hippocampal atrophy in patients
              with Alzheimer's disease. Given the importance of hippocampal
              atrophy in Alzheimer's disease, it is imperative that techniques
              are developed for detection of TDP-43 in vivo. FUNDING: US

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Progressive neuronal death is the key pathological
              feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the molecular
              mechanisms underlying the neuronal death in AD patients have not
              been fully elucidated. Necroptosis reportedly activates and
              induces neuronal death in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD);
              however, the main mediators and mechanisms underlying necroptosis
              induction in AD remain elusive. METHODS: The function of
              hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau) in inducing necroptosis in
              neuronal cell was examined using Western blotting, RT-PCR and
              flow cytometry. Tau-induced inflammation was identified via RNA
              sequencing and transwell assay. Pharmacological methods and
              CRISPR-Cas9 technology were used to verify the role of necrosome
              proteins in pTau-stimulated neuronal death and inflammation.
              TauP301S model mice were treated with Nec-1 s to evaluate the
              role of necroptosis in tau pathology. RESULTS:
              Hyperphosphorylated tau could induce necroptosis in neuronal
              cells by promoting the formation of the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL
              necrosome. In addition, pTau significantly stimulated
              cell-autonomous overexpression of cytokines and chemokines via
              the intracellular nuclear factor kappa B (NF-$\kappa$B) signaling
              pathway. Importantly, the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL axis was essential for
              the pTau-mediated NF-$\kappa$B activation and cytokine storm.
              Furthermore, necroptosis stimulation, NF-$\kappa$B activation,
              and cytokine induction have been detected in TauP301S mice and
              blocking necroptosis markedly ameliorated behavioral defects and
              excessive neuroinflammation in AD mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study,
              for the first time, revealed that pTau contributes to neuronal
              death by inducing necroptosis and inflammation, mediated by
              activating the RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL and NF-$\kappa$B pathways,

              development of new drug-based therapies for the neurodegenerative
              condition of Parkinson's disease (PD) have been generated. These
              reviews have followed the progress of both ``symptomatic
              treatments'' (ST - improves/reduces symptoms of the condition)
              and ``disease modifying treatments'' (DMT - attempts to
              delay/slow progression by addressing the underlying biology of
              PD). Additional efforts have been made to further categorize
              these experimental treatments based on their mechanisms of action
              and class of drug. METHODS: A dataset of clinical trials for drug
              therapies in PD was obtained using trial data downloaded from the
              ClinicalTrials.gov online registry. A breakdown analysis of all
              the studies that were active as of January 31st, 2023, was
              conducted. RESULTS: There was a total of 139 clinical trials
              registered on the ClinicalTrials.gov website as active (with 35
              trials newly registered since our last report). Of these trials,
              76 (55\%) were considered ST and 63 (45\%) were designated DMT.
              Similar to previous years, approximately a third of the studies
              were in Phase 1 (n = 47; 34\%), half (n = 72, 52\%) were in Phase
              2 and there were 20 (14\%) studies in Phase 3. Novel therapies
              again represented the most dominant group of experimental
              treatments in this year's report with 58 (42\%) trials testing
              new agents. Repurposed drugs are present in a third (n = 49,
              35\%) of trials, with reformulations and new claims representing
              19\% and 4\% of studies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our fourth
              annual review of active clinical trials evaluating ST and DMT
              therapeutics for PD demonstrates that the drug development
              pipeline is dynamic and evolving. The slow progress and lack of

  abstract = "Proliferation and activation of microglia in the brain,
              concentrated around amyloid plaques, is a prominent feature of
              Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human genetics data point to a key role
              for microglia in the pathogenesis of AD. The majority of risk
              genes for AD are highly expressed (and many are selectively
              expressed) by microglia in the brain. There is mounting evidence
              that microglia protect against the incidence of AD, as impaired
              microglial activities and altered microglial responses to
              $\beta$-amyloid are associated with increased AD risk. On the
              other hand, there is also abundant evidence that activated
              microglia can be harmful to neurons. Microglia can mediate
              synapse loss by engulfment of synapses, likely via a
              complement-dependent mechanism; they can also exacerbate tau
              pathology and secrete inflammatory factors that can injure

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Neuroinflammation is thought to contribute to the
              pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), yet numerous studies
              have demonstrated a beneficial role for neuroinflammation in
              amyloid plaque clearance. We have previously shown that sustained
              expression of IL-1$\beta$ in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice
              decreases amyloid plaque burden independent of recruited CCR2+
              myeloid cells, suggesting resident microglia as the main
              phagocytic effectors of IL-1$\beta$-induced plaque clearance. To
              date, however, the mechanisms of IL-1$\beta$-induced plaque
              clearance remain poorly understood. METHODS: To determine whether
              microglia are involved in IL-1$\beta$-induced plaque clearance,
              APP/PS1 mice induced to express mature human IL-1$\beta$ in the
              hippocampus via adenoviral transduction were treated with the
              A$\beta$ fluorescent probe methoxy-X04 (MX04) and microglial
              internalization of fibrillar A$\beta$ (fA$\beta$) was analyzed by
              flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. To assess microglial
              proliferation, APP/PS1 mice transduced with IL-1$\beta$ or
              control were injected intraperitoneally with BrdU and hippocampal
              tissue was analyzed by flow cytometry. RNAseq analysis was
              conducted on microglia FACS sorted from the hippocampus of
              control or IL-1$\beta$-treated APP/PS1 mice. These microglia were
              also sorted based on MX04 labeling (MX04+ and MX04- microglia).
              RESULTS: Resident microglia (CD45loCD11b+) constituted > 70\% of
              the MX04+ cells in both Phe- and IL-1$\beta$-treated conditions,
              and < 15\% of MX04+ cells were recruited myeloid cells
              (CD45hiCD11b+). However, IL-1$\beta$ treatment did not augment
              the percentage of MX04+ microglia nor the quantity of fA$\beta$
              internalized by individual microglia. Instead, IL-1$\beta$
              increased the total number of MX04+ microglia in the hippocampus
              due to IL-1$\beta$-induced proliferation. In addition,
              transcriptomic analyses revealed that IL-1$\beta$ treatment was
              associated with large-scale changes in the expression of genes
              related to immune responses, proliferation, and cytokine
              signaling. CONCLUSIONS: These studies show that IL-1$\beta$
              overexpression early in amyloid pathogenesis induces a change in
              the microglial gene expression profile and an expansion of
              microglial cells that facilitates A$\beta$ plaque clearance.",

  abstract  = "In early 2012, the global scientific community erupted with news
               that the elusive Higgs boson had likely been found, providing
               potent validation for the Standard Model of how the universe
               works. Scientists from more than one hundred countries
               contributed to this discovery---proving, beyond any doubt, that
               a new era in science had arrived, an era of multinationalism and
               cooperative reach. Globalization, the Internet, and digital
               technology all play a role in making this new era possible, but
               something more fundamental is also at work. In all scientific
               endeavors lies the ancient drive for sharing ideas and
               knowledge, and now this can be accomplished in a single
               tongue--- English. But is this a good thing? In Does Science
               Need a Global Language?, Scott L. Montgomery seeks to answer
               this question by investigating the phenomenon of global English
               in science, how and why it came about, the forms in which it
               appears, what advantages and disadvantages it brings, and what
               its future might be. He also examines the consequences of a
               global tongue, considering especially emerging and developing
               nations, where research is still at a relatively early stage and
               English is not yet firmly established. Throughout the book, he
               includes important insights from a broad range of perspectives
               in linguistics, history, education, geopolitics, and more. Each
               chapter includes striking and revealing anecdotes from the
               front-line experiences of today's scientists, some of whom have
               struggled with the reality of global scientific English. He
               explores topics such as student mobility, publication trends,
               world Englishes, language endangerment, and second language
               learning, among many others. What he uncovers will challenge
               readers to rethink their assumptions about the direction of
               contemporary science, as well as its future.",

              chromosome 19, within the genomic region previously associated
              with late-onset familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have
              studied apoE phenotype expression and the corresponding allele
              frequencies ($\in$2, $\in$3, $\in$4) in 91 patients with sporadic

              controls, p < 0·01). Analysis of $\in$4 allele frequency as a
              function of age revealed a bimodal distribution, with peaks at 65
              and 75 years. In bearers of $\in$4 in whom AD develops this
              tended to happen earlier in life than in those with $\in$3 or
              $\in$2. The $\in$4/AD association was more pronounced in women.

              utilizing genome-wide association study datasets on these traits.
              A map of COVID-19-driven molecular pathways was constructed to
              investigate potential mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 and AD
              connection. Genetic correlation analyses indicated that AD had a
              significant positive genetic correlation with hospitalized
              COVID-19 (rg = 0.271). The MR analysis from the
              inverse-variance-weighted model showed that genetic liabilities
              to hospitalized COVID-19 (odds ratio: 1.02, 95\% confidence

              the development of AD, while suffering a mild case of COVID-19
              may not increase the risk for AD. The influence of COVID-19 on AD

              Contemporary estimates are needed to plan for future care
              provision, but much evidence is decades old. We aimed to
              investigate whether the prevalence of dementia had changed in the
              past two decades by repeating the same approach and diagnostic
              methods as used in the Medical Research Council Cognitive
              Function and Ageing Study (MRC CFAS) in three of the original
              study areas in England. METHODS: Between 1989 and 1994, MRC CFAS
              investigators did baseline interviews in populations aged 65
              years and older in six geographically defined areas in England
              and Wales. A two stage process, with screening followed by
              diagnostic assessment, was used to obtain data for algorithmic
              diagnoses (geriatric mental state-automated geriatric examination
              for computer assisted taxonomy), which were then used to estimate
              dementia prevalence. Data from three of these
              areas--Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham--were selected
              for CFAS I. Between 2008 and 2011, new fieldwork was done in the
              same three areas for the CFAS II study. For both CFAS I and II,
              each area needed to include 2500 individuals aged 65 years and
              older to provide power for geographical and generational
              comparison. Sampling was stratified according to age group (65-74
              years vs $\geq$75 years). CFAS II used identical sampling,
              approach, and diagnostic methods to CFAS I, except that screening
              and assessement were combined into one stage. Prevalence
              estimates were calculated using inverse probability weighting
              methods to adjust for sampling design and non-response. Full
              likelihood Bayesian models were used to investigate informative
              non-response. FINDINGS: 7635 people aged 65 years or older were
              interviewed in CFAS I (9602 approached, 80\% response) in
              Cambridgeshire, Newcastle, and Nottingham, with 1457 being
              diagnostically assessed. In the same geographical areas, the CFAS
              II investigators interviewed 7796 individuals (14,242 approached,
              242 with limited frailty information, 56\% response). Using CFAS
              I age and sex specific estimates of prevalence in individuals
              aged 65 years or older, standardised to the 2011 population,
              8·3\% (884,000) of this population would be expected to have
              dementia in 2011. However, CFAS II shows that the prevalence is
              lower (6·5\%; 670,000), a decrease of 1·8\% (odds ratio for CFAS
              II vs CFAS I 0·7, 95\% CI 0·6-0·9, p=0·003). Sensitivity analyses
              suggest that these estimates are robust to the change in
              response. INTERPRETATION: This study provides further evidence
              that a cohort effect exists in dementia prevalence. Later-born
              populations have a lower risk of prevalent dementia than those
              born earlier in the past century. FUNDING: UK Medical Research

              neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau
              protein. The N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR), ionotropic
              glutamate receptor, are essential for processes like learning and
              memory. An excessive activation of NMDARs has been associated
              with neuronal loss. The discovery of extrasynaptic NMDARs
              provided a rational and physiological explanation between
              physiological and excitotoxic actions of glutamate. Memantine
              (MEM), an antagonist of extrasynaptic NMDAR, is currently used
              for the treatment of AD jointly with acetylcholinesterase
              inhibitors. It has been demonstrated that MEM preferentially
              prevents the excessive continuous extrasynaptic NMDAR disease
              activation and therefore prevents neuronal cell death induced by
              excitotoxicity without disrupting physiological synaptic

              effects in clinical applications while, in preclinical stages,

              aggregation, or downstream neurotoxic consequences, in part
              through the blockade of extrasynaptic NMDAR. Thus, the focus of
              this review is primarily to discuss the efficacy of MEM in
              preclinical models of AD, consider possible combinations of this
              drug with others, and then evaluate possible reasons for its lack
              of efficacy in clinical trials. Finally, applications in other

               treatment of Alzheimer's disease",
  author    = "Rogawski, Michael A and Wenk, Gary L",
  abstract  = "ABSTRACTMemantine has been demonstrated to be safe and effective
               in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While
               the neurobiological basis for the therapeutic activity of
               memantine is not fully understood, the drug is not a
               cholinesterase inhibitor and, therefore, acts differently from
               current AD therapies. Memantine can interact with a variety of
               ligand‐gated ion channels. However, NMDA receptors appear to be
               a key target of memantine at therapeutic concentrations.
               Memantine is an uncompetitive (channel blocking) NMDA receptor
               antagonist. Like other NMDA receptor antagonists, memantine at
               high concentrations can inhibit mechanisms of synaptic
               plasticity that are believed to underlie learning and memory.
               However, at lower, clinically relevant concentrations memantine
               can under some circumstances promote synaptic plasticity and
               preserve or enhance memory in animal models of AD. In addition,
               memantine can protect against the excitotoxic destruction of
               cholinergic neurons. Blockade of NMDA receptors by memantine
               could theoretically confer disease‐modifying activity in AD by
               inhibiting the ``weak'' NMDA receptor‐dependent excitotoxicity
               that has been hypothesized to play a role in the progressive
               neuronal loss that underlies the evolving dementia. Moreover,
               recent in vitro studies suggest that memantine abrogates
               $\beta$‐amyloid (A$\beta$) toxicity and possibly inhibits
               A$\beta$ production. Considerable attention has focused on the
               investigation of theories to explain the better tolerability of
               memantine over other NMDA receptor antagonists, particularly
               those that act by a similar channel blocking mechanism such as
               dissociative anesthetic‐like agents (phencyclidine, ketamine,
               MK‐801). A variety of channel‐level factors could be relevant,
               including fast channel‐blocking kinetics and strong
               voltage‐dependence (allowing rapid relief of block during
               synaptic activity), as well as reduced trapping (permitting
               egress from closed channels). These factors may allow memantine
               to block channel activity induced by low, tonic levels of
               glutamate --- an action that might contribute to symptomatic
               improvement and could theoretically protect against weak
               excitotoxicity --- while sparing synaptic responses required for
               normal behavioral functioning, cognition and memory.",

              case of reversible inhibitors being commonly applied in
              neurodegenerative disorders treatment, special attention is paid
              to currently approved drugs (donepezil, rivastigmine and
              galantamine) in the pharmacotherapy of Alzheimer's disease, and
              toxic carbamates used as pesticides. Subsequently, mechanism of
              irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibition induced by
              organophosphorus compounds (insecticides and nerve agents), and
              their specific and nonspecific toxic effects are described, as
              well as irreversible inhibitors having pharmacological
              implementation. In addition, the pharmacological treatment of
              intoxication caused by organophosphates is presented, with
              emphasis on oxime reactivators of the inhibited enzyme activity
              administering as causal drugs after the poisoning. Besides,
              organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides can be detoxified in
              mammals through enzymatic hydrolysis before they reach targets in
              the nervous system. Carboxylesterases most effectively decompose
              carbamates, whereas the most successful route of organophosphates
              detoxification is their degradation by corresponding
              phosphotriesterases.",

              underlying the potential beneficial effects of rosiglitazone in
              Alzheimer's disease remain unclear. In previous studies, we
              observed that Tg2576 Alzheimer mice develop peripheral insulin
              resistance with age and have much higher serum corticosterone
              levels than wild-type mice when fasted overnight. We further
              showed that both of these defects can be ameliorated by

              behavioral testing which involves repetitive overnight fasting,
              Tg2576 mice administered rosiglitazone exhibited better spatial

              insulin ratios have been observed in patients with Alzheimer
              disease (AD). Furthermore, intracerebroventricular or IV insulin
              administration improve memory, alter evoked potentials, and
              modulate neurotransmitters, possibly by augmenting low brain
              levels. After intranasal administration, insulin-like peptides
              follow extracellular pathways to the brain within 15 minutes.
              OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that daily intranasal insulin
              treatment would facilitate cognition in patients with early AD or
              its prodrome, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The
              proportion of verbal information retained after a delay period
              was the planned primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome
              measures included attention, caregiver rating of functional
              status, and plasma levels of insulin, glucose, beta-amyloid, and
              cortisol. METHODS: Twenty-five participants were randomly
              assigned to receive either placebo (n = 12) or 20 IU BID
              intranasal insulin treatment (n = 13) using an electronic
              atomizer, and 24 participants completed the study. Participants,
              caregivers, and all clinical evaluators were blinded to treatment
              assignment. Cognitive measures and blood were obtained at
              baseline and after 21 days of treatment. RESULTS: Fasting plasma
              glucose and insulin were unchanged with treatment. The
              insulin-treated group retained more verbal information after a
              delay compared with the placebo-assigned group (p = 0.0374).
              Insulin-treated subjects also showed improved attention (p =
              0.0108) and functional status (p = 0.0410). Insulin treatment
              raised fasting plasma concentrations of the short form of the
              beta-amyloid peptide (A beta 40; p = 0.0471) without affecting
              the longer isoform (A beta 42), resulting in an increased A beta
              40/42 ratio (p = 0.0207). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this pilot
              study support further investigation of the benefits of intranasal
              insulin for patients with Alzheimer disease, and suggest that
              intranasal peptide administration may be a novel approach to the

              normal controls each underwent three intranasal treatment
              conditions consisting of saline (placebo) or insulin (20 or 40
              IU). Cognition was tested 15 min post-treatment, and blood was
              acquired at baseline and 45 min after treatment. Intranasal
              insulin treatment did not change plasma insulin or glucose

              Unexpectedly, memory-impaired epsilon4+ subjects showed poorer
              recall following insulin administration on one test of memory.
              These findings suggest that intranasal insulin administration may
              have therapeutic benefit without the risk of peripheral

              pathogenesis will require a framework that mechanistically
              interlinks all these phenomena. Currently, there is a rapid
              growth in the literature pointing toward insulin deficiency and
              insulin resistance as mediators of AD-type neurodegeneration, but
              this surge of new information is riddled with conflicting and
              unresolved concepts regarding the potential contributions of type
              2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), metabolic syndrome, and obesity to AD
              pathogenesis. Herein, we review the evidence that (1) T2DM causes
              brain insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and cognitive
              impairment, but its aggregate effects fall far short of mimicking
              AD; (2) extensive disturbances in brain insulin and insulin-like
              growth factor (IGF) signaling mechanisms represent early and
              progressive abnormalities and could account for the majority of
              molecular, biochemical, and histopathological lesions in AD; (3)

              with insulin sensitizer agents, i.e., drugs currently used to
              treat T2DM. We conclude that the term ``type 3 diabetes''
              accurately reflects the fact that AD represents a form of
              diabetes that selectively involves the brain and has molecular
              and biochemical features that overlap with both type 1 diabetes

              proteolytically derived from beta-amyloid precursor protein
              (betaAPP). betaAPP metabolism is highly regulated via various
              signal transduction systems, e.g., several serine/threonine
              kinases and phosphatases. Several growth factors known to act via
              receptor tyrosine kinases also have been demonstrated to regulate
              sbetaAPP secretion. Among these receptors, insulin and
              insulin-like growth factor-1 receptors are highly expressed in

              insulin significantly reduces intracellular accumulation of Abeta

              Prospective population-based cohort study among 6,370 elderly
              subjects. At baseline study participants were examined for
              presence of diabetes mellitus. Nondemented participants were
              followed up, on average, for 2.1 years. Incident dementia was
              diagnosed using a three-step screening and comprehensive
              diagnostic workup. To complete the follow-up, medical files were

              vascular dementia, but recent studies have established that T2DM
              is also associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). With the
              increase in the number of elderly individuals with T2DM, the

              AD patients has increased, researchers have strived to understand
              the disease and develop its treatment, such as medical
              experiments and literature analysis. In the area of literature
              analysis, several traditional studies analyzed the literature at
              the macro level like author, journal, and institution. However,
              analysis of the literature both at the macro level and micro
              level will allow for better recognizing the AD research field.
              Therefore, in this study we adopt a more comprehensive approach
              to analyze the AD literature, which consists of productivity
              analysis (year, journal/proceeding, author, and Medical Subject
              Heading terms), network analysis (co-occurrence frequency,
              centrality, and community) and content analysis. To this end, we
              collect metadata of 96,081 articles retrieved from PubMed. We
              specifically perform the concept graph-based network analysis
              applying the five centrality measures after mapping the semantic
              relationship between the UMLS concepts from the AD literature. We
              also analyze the time-series topical trend using the Dirichlet
              multinomial regression topic modeling technique. The results
              indicate that the year 2013 is the most productive year and
              Journal of Alzheimer's Disease the most productive journal. In
              discovery of the core biological entities and their relationships
              resided in the AD related PubMed literature, the relationship
              with glycogen storage disease is founded most frequently
              mentioned. In addition, we analyze 16 main topics of the AD
              literature and find a noticeable increasing trend in the topic of
              transgenic mouse.",

               Alzheimer's disease (AD) including age, familial inheritance,
               exposure to aluminium, traumatic brain injury (TBI), and
               associated co-morbidities such as vascular disease and
               infection. In the light of recent evidence, this review
               reconsiders these risk factors, identifies those currently
               regarded as important, and discusses various hypotheses to
               explain how they may cause AD. Rare forms of early-onset
               familial AD (EO-FAD) are strongly linked to causal gene
               mutations, viz. mutations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and
               presenilin (PSEN1/2) genes. By contrast, late-onset sporadic AD
               (LO-SAD) is a multifactorial disorder in which age-related
               changes, genetic risk factors, such as allelic variation in
               apolipoprotein E (Apo E) and many other genes, vascular disease,
               TBI and risk factors associated with diet, the immune system,
               mitochondrial function, metal exposure, and infection are all
               implicated. These risk factors may act collectively to cause AD
               pathology: 1) by promoting the liberation of oxygen free
               radicals with age, 2) via environmental stress acting on
               regulatory genes early and later in life ('dual hit'
               hypothesis), or 3) by increasing the cumulative 'allostatic
               load' on the body over a lifetime. As a consequence, life-style
               changes which reduce the impact of these factors may be
               necessary to lower the risk of AD.",

              analyses were run at both voxel- and region-of-interest levels.
              11C-PiB retention in AD showed the most diffuse uptake pattern

              development of AD dementia. The antemortem diagnosis of AD is

              include fluid-based biomarkers such as those present in
              cerebrospinal fluid and plasma or diagnostic imaging methods.
              Currently, the therapeutic armory available focuses on symptom

              neuro-inflammation, and neuronal injury. Clinical trials focusing
              on new drugs for AD were documented in 2020, but subsequent
              developments have emerged since then. Notably, the US-FDA has
              approved Aducanumab and Lecanemab, both antibodies targeting
              amyloid, marking the end of a nearly two-decade period without
              new AD drugs. In this comprehensive report, we review all trials
              listed in clinicaltrials.gov, elucidating their underlying
              mechanisms and study designs. Ongoing clinical trials are
              investigating numerous promising new drugs for AD. The main
              trends in these trials involve pathophysiology-based,
              disease-modifying therapies and the recruitment of participants
              in earlier stages of the disease. These trends underscore the
              significance of conducting fundamental research on
              pathophysiology, prevention, and intervention prior to the
              occurrence of brain damage caused by AD.",

  abstract = "This article describes the public health impact of Alzheimer's
              disease, including prevalence and incidence, mortality and
              morbidity, use and costs of care, and the overall impact on
              family caregivers, the dementia workforce and society. The
              Special Report examines the patient journey from awareness of
              cognitive changes to potential treatment with drugs that change
              the underlying biology of Alzheimer's. An estimated 6.7 million
              Americans age 65 and older are living with Alzheimer's dementia
              today. This number could grow to 13.8 million by 2060 barring the
              development of medical breakthroughs to prevent, slow or cure AD.
              Official death certificates recorded 121,499 deaths from AD in
              2019, and Alzheimer's disease was officially listed as the
              sixth-leading cause of death in the United States. In 2020 and
              2021, when COVID-19 entered the ranks of the top ten causes of
              death, Alzheimer's was the seventh-leading cause of death.
              Alzheimer's remains the fifth-leading cause of death among
              Americans age 65 and older. Between 2000 and 2019, deaths from
              stroke, heart disease and HIV decreased, whereas reported deaths
              from AD increased more than 145\%. This trajectory of deaths from
              AD was likely exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and
              2021. More than 11 million family members and other unpaid
              caregivers provided an estimated 18 billion hours of care to
              people with Alzheimer's or other dementias in 2022. These figures
              reflect a decline in the number of caregivers compared with a
              decade earlier, as well as an increase in the amount of care
              provided by each remaining caregiver. Unpaid dementia caregiving
              was valued at $339.5 billion in 2022. Its costs, however, extend
              to family caregivers' increased risk for emotional distress and
              negative mental and physical health outcomes - costs that have
              been aggravated by COVID-19. Members of the paid health care
              workforce are involved in diagnosing, treating and caring for
              people with dementia. In recent years, however, a shortage of
              such workers has developed in the United States. This shortage -
              brought about, in part, by COVID-19 - has occurred at a time when
              more members of the dementia care workforce are needed.
              Therefore, programs will be needed to attract workers and better
              train health care teams. Average per-person Medicare payments for
              services to beneficiaries age 65 and older with AD or other
              dementias are almost three times as great as payments for
              beneficiaries without these conditions, and Medicaid payments are
              more than 22 times as great. Total payments in 2023 for health
              care, long-term care and hospice services for people age 65 and
              older with dementia are estimated to be $345 billion. The Special
              Report examines whether there will be sufficient numbers of
              physician specialists to provide Alzheimer's care and treatment
              now that two drugs are available that change the underlying
              biology of Alzheimer's disease.",

              groups, sex, and disease stage (AD dementia, prodromal AD, and

              Alzheimer's disease (AD) field to understand the disease
              etiology, progression and discover treatments for AD. Many
              mechanistic hypotheses, therapeutic targets and treatment
              strategies have been proposed in the last few decades. Reviewing
              previous work and staying current on this ever-growing body of AD
              publications is an essential yet difficult task for AD
              researchers. Methods In this study, we designed and implemented a
              natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to extract
              gene-specific neurodegenerative disease (ND) -focused information
              from the PubMed database. The collected publication information
              was filtered and cleaned to construct AD-related gene-specific
              publication profiles. Six categories of AD-related information
              are extracted from the processed publication data: publication
              trend by year, dementia type occurrence, brain region occurrence,
              mouse model information, keywords occurrence, and co-occurring
              genes. A user-friendly web portal is then developed using Django
              framework to provide gene query functions and data visualizations
              for the generalized and summarized publication information.
              Results By implementing the NLP pipeline, we extracted
              gene-specific ND-related publication information from the
              abstracts of the publications in the PubMed database. The results
              are summarized and visualized through an interactive web query
              portal. Multiple visualization windows display the ND publication
              trends, mouse models used, dementia types, involved brain
              regions, keywords to major AD-related biological processes, and
              co-occurring genes. Direct links to PubMed sites are provided for
              all recorded publications on the query result page of the web
              portal. Conclusion The resulting portal is a valuable tool and
              data source for quick querying and displaying AD publications
              tailored to users' interested research areas and gene targets,
              which is especially convenient for users without informatic
              mining skills. Our study will not only keep AD field researchers
              updated with the progress of AD research, assist them in
              conducting preliminary examinations efficiently, but also offers
              additional support for hypothesis generation and validation which

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Similar to most chronic diseases, Alzheimer's disease
              (AD) develops slowly from a preclinical phase into a fully
              expressed clinical syndrome. We aimed to use longitudinal data to
              calculate the rates of amyloid $\beta$ (A$\beta$) deposition,
              cerebral atrophy, and cognitive decline. METHODS: In this
              prospective cohort study, healthy controls, patients with mild
              cognitive impairment (MCI), and patients with AD were assessed at
              enrolment and every 18 months. At every visit, participants
              underwent neuropsychological examination, MRI, and a
              carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B ((11)C-PiB) PET scan. We
              included participants with three or more (11)C-PiB PET follow-up
              assessments. A$\beta$ burden was expressed as (11)C-PiB
              standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR) with the cerebellar cortex
              as reference region. An SUVR of 1·5 was used to discriminate high
              from low A$\beta$ burdens. The slope of the regression plots over
              3-5 years was used to estimate rates of change for A$\beta$
              deposition, MRI volumetrics, and cognition. We included those
              participants with a positive rate of A$\beta$ deposition to
              calculate the trajectory of each variable over time. FINDINGS:
              200 participants (145 healthy controls, 36 participants with MCI,
              and 19 participants with AD) were assessed at enrolment and every
              18 months for a mean follow-up of 3·8 (95\% CI CI 3·6-3·9) years.
              At baseline, significantly higher A$\beta$ burdens were noted in
              patients with AD (2·27, SD 0·43) and those with MCI (1·94, 0·64)
              than in healthy controls (1·38, 0·39). At follow-up, 163 (82\%)
              of the 200 participants showed positive rates of A$\beta$
              accumulation. A$\beta$ deposition was estimated to take 19·2
              (95\% CI 16·8-22·5) years in an almost linear fashion-with a mean
              increase of 0·043 (95\% CI 0·037-0·049) SUVR per year-to go from
              the threshold of (11)C-PiB positivity (1·5 SUVR) to the levels
              observed in AD. It was estimated to take 12·0 (95\% CI 10·1-14·9)
              years from the levels observed in healthy controls with low
              A$\beta$ deposition (1·2 [SD 0·1] SUVR) to the threshold of
              (11)C-PiB positivity. As AD progressed, the rate of A$\beta$
              deposition slowed towards a plateau. Our projections suggest a
              prolonged preclinical phase of AD in which A$\beta$ deposition
              reaches our threshold of positivity at 17·0 (95\% CI 14·9-19·9)
              years, hippocampal atrophy at 4·2 (3·6-5·1) years, and memory
              impairment at 3·3 (2·5-4·5) years before the onset of dementia

              deposition is slow and protracted, likely to extend for more than
              two decades. Such predictions of the rate of preclinical changes
              and the onset of the clinical phase of AD will facilitate the

  abstract  = "Abstract Systematic review, meta-analysis and other forms of
               evidence synthesis are critical to strengthen the evidence base
               concerning conservation issues and to answer ecological and
               evolutionary questions. Synthesis lags behind the pace of
               scientific publishing, however, due to time and resource costs
               which partial automation of evidence synthesis tasks could
               reduce. Additionally, current methods of retrieving evidence for
               synthesis are susceptible to bias towards studies with which
               researchers are familiar. In fields that lack standardized
               terminology encoded in an ontology, including ecology and
               evolution, research teams can unintentionally exclude articles
               from the review by omitting synonymous phrases in their search
               terms. To combat these problems, we developed a quick,
               objective, reproducible method for generating search strategies
               that uses text mining and keyword co-occurrence networks to
               identify the most important terms for a review. The method
               reduces bias in search strategy development because it does not
               rely on a predetermined set of articles and can improve search
               recall by identifying synonymous terms that research teams might
               otherwise omit. When tested against the search strategies used
               in published environmental systematic reviews, our method
               performs as well as the published searches and retrieves
               gold-standard hits that replicated versions of the original
               searches do not. Because the method is quasi-automated, the
               amount of time required to develop a search strategy, conduct
               searches, and assemble results is reduced from approximately
               17?34 hr to under 2 hr. To facilitate use of the method for
               environmental evidence synthesis, we implemented the method in
               the R package litsearchr, which also contains a suite of
               functions to improve efficiency of systematic reviews by

               Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD). Yet, most research is
               undermined by low interpretability and specificity. METHODS:
               Combining statistical and machine learning analyses of natural
               speech data, we aimed to discriminate ADD patients from healthy
               controls (HCs) based on automated measures of domains typically
               affected in ADD: semantic granularity (coarseness of concepts)
               and ongoing semantic variability (conceptual closeness of
               successive words). To test for specificity, we replicated the
               analyses on Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. RESULTS: Relative
               to controls, ADD (but not PD) patients exhibited significant
               differences in both measures. Also, these features robustly
               discriminated between ADD patients and HC, while yielding
               near-chance classification between PD patients and HCs.
               DISCUSSION: Automated discourse-level semantic analyses can
               reveal objective, interpretable, and specific markers of ADD,

              neurodegenerative diseases. Knowledge graphs can provide
              comprehensive and semantic representation for heterogeneous data,
              and have been successfully leveraged in many biomedical
              applications including drug repurposing. Our objective is to
              construct a knowledge graph from literature to study the
              relations between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chemicals, drugs
              and dietary supplements in order to identify opportunities to
              prevent or delay neurodegenerative progression. We collected
              biomedical annotations and extracted their relations using SemRep
              via SemMedDB. We used both a BERT-based classifier and rule-based
              methods during data preprocessing to exclude noise while
              preserving most AD-related semantic triples. The 1,672,110
              filtered triples were used to train with knowledge graph
              completion algorithms (i.e., TransE, DistMult, and ComplEx) to
              predict candidates that might be helpful for AD treatment or
              prevention. RESULTS: Among three knowledge graph completion
              models, TransE outperformed the other two (MR = 10.53, Hits@1 =
              0.28). We leveraged the time-slicing technique to further
              evaluate the prediction results. We found supporting evidence for
              most highly ranked candidates predicted by our model which
              indicates that our approach can inform reliable new knowledge.
              CONCLUSION: This paper shows that our graph mining model can
              predict reliable new relationships between AD and other entities
              (i.e., dietary supplements, chemicals, and drugs). The knowledge

              of dementia in the elderly but despite progress made in recent
              years towards a mechanistic understanding, there is still an
              urgent need for disease modification therapy and for early
              diagnostic tests. Substantial international efforts are being
              made to discover and validate biomarkers for AD using candidate
              analytes and various data-driven 'omics' approaches.
              Cerebrospinal fluid is in many ways the tissue of choice for
              biomarkers of brain disease but is limited by patient and
              clinician acceptability, and increasing attention is being paid
              to the search for blood-based biomarkers. The aim of this study
              was to use a novel in silico approach to discover a set of
              candidate biomarkers for AD. METHODS: We used an in silico
              literature mining approach to identify potential biomarkers by
              creating a summarized set of assertional metadata derived from
              relevant legacy information. We then assessed the validity of
              this approach using direct assays of the identified biomarkers in
              plasma by immunodetection methods. RESULTS: Using this in silico
              approach, we identified 25 biomarker candidates, at least three
              of which have subsequently been reported to be altered in blood
              or CSF from AD patients. Two further candidate biomarkers,
              indicated from the in silico approach, were choline
              acetyltransferase and urokinase-type plasminogen activator
              receptor. Using immunodetection, we showed that, in a large
              sample set, these markers are either altered in disease or
              correlate with MRI markers of atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: These data
              support as a proof of concept the use of data mining and in
              silico analyses to derive valid biomarker candidates for AD and,

  abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Given the phenomenon of aging
              population, dementias arise as a complex health problem
              throughout the world. Several methods of machine learning have
              been applied to the task of predicting dementias. Given its
              diagnostic complexity, the great challenge lies in distinguishing
              patients with some type of dementia from healthy people.
              Particularly in the early stages, the diagnosis positively
              impacts the quality of life of both the patient and the family.
              This work presents a hybrid data mining model, involving the
              mining of texts integrated to the mining of structured data. This
              model aims to assist specialists in the diagnosis of patients
              with clinical suspicion of dementia. METHODS: The experiments
              were conducted from a set of 605 medical records with 19
              different attributes about patients with cognitive decline
              reports. Firstly, a new structured attribute was created from a
              text mining process. It was the result of clustering the
              patient's pathological history information stored in an
              unstructured textual attribute. Classification algorithms
              (na{\"\i}ve bayes, bayesian belief networks and decision trees)
              were applied to obtain Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive
              impairment predictive models. Ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting
              and Random Forests) were used in order to improve the accuracy of
              the generated models. These methods were applied in two datasets:
              one containing only the original structured data; the other
              containing the original structured data with the inclusion of the
              new attribute resulting from the text mining (hybrid model).
              RESULTS: The models' accuracy metrics obtained from the two
              different datasets were compared. The results evidenced the
              greater effectiveness of the hybrid model in the diagnostic
              prediction for the pathologies of interest. CONCLUSIONS: When
              analysing the different methods of classification and clustering
              used, the better rates related to the precision and sensitivity
              of the pathologies under study were obtained with hybrid models
